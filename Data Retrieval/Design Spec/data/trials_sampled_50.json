    "Intervention(s)": "In 1998, a local non-governmental organization (NGO) launched a program known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) to provide deworming medication to individuals enrolled in 75 primary schools in Busia District, a densely-settled farming region of rural western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria. The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicated that these divisions had high rates of helminth infection at over 90%. Using modified WHO infection thresholds (Brooker et al., 2000b), roughly one-third of children in the sample had “moderate to heavy” infections with at least one helminth at the time of the baseline survey, a rate not atypical by regional standards (Brooker et al., 2000a). The 1998 Kenya DHS indicated that 85% of children in western Kenya, in the relevant age range of 8-18 years, were enrolled in school – suggesting that the sample was broadly representative of western Kenyan children as a whole at the time. \r The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups. Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving the drugs in 2001. The project design implies that in 1998, Group 1 schools were treatment schools while Group 2 and 3 schools were the control, and in 1999 and 2000, Group 1 and 2 schools were the treatment schools and Group 3 schools the control, and so on. In 2002 all schools received free treatment. Children in Group 1 and 2 schools thus received two to three more years of deworming than Group 3 children. Deworming drugs were offered twice per year in treatment schools.\r This study uses the Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP) to test several interventions including the following: social links, cost-sharing, health education, and verbal commitment. \r Social links: Parent questionnaire respondents were asked for information on their closest social links: the five friends they speak with most frequently, the five relatives they speak with most frequently, additional social contacts whose children attend local primary schools, and individuals with whom they speak specifically about child health issues. These individuals are collectively referred to as the respondent’s direct “social links.” The survey also collected information on the deworming treatment status of social links’ children and the effects of treatment on their health, how frequently the respondent speaks with each social link, which primary schools links’ children attend, the global positioning system (GPS) location of the respondent’s home, and respondent’s knowledge of worm infections and attitudes toward deworming. \r Cost-sharing: Between 1998 and 1999 PSDP delivered free deworming pills to 50 sample schools. In 2001, they were randomized again to assign half the schools to a cost-sharing intervention while the other half continued to receive free treatment. Two thirds of the schools participating in cost-sharing received albendazole at a cost of USD $0.40 per family, and one third received both albendazole and praziquantel (depending on the local prevalence of schistosomiasis) at a cost of USD $1.30 per family.\r Health education: In addition to medication, all treatment schools received regular public health lectures, wall charts on worm prevention, and a full-day training session for two teachers from each school. The lectures and teacher training provided information on worm prevention behaviors—including washing hands before meals, wearing shoes, and not swimming in the lake. \r Verbal commitment: A random subsample of pupils were asked whether they were planning to come to school on the next treatment day and whether the PSDP workers should bring pills for them on that day: 98 percent of children answered “yes” to both questions. All pupils interviewed—including both those offered the opportunity for verbal commitment and those not offered this opportunity—were provided the same information on the effects of deworming and the upcoming date of medical treatment.",

Studies in which medical treatment is randomized at the individual level potentially doubly underestimate the benefits of treatment, missing externality benefits to the comparison group from reduced disease transmission, and therefore also underestimating benefits for the treatment group. We evaluate a Kenyan project in which school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall program effects. The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of boosting school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and school participation among untreated children in both treatment schools and neighboring schools, and these externalities are large enough to justify fully subsidizing treatment. Yet we do not find evidence that deworming improved academic test scores.",

    "Intervention(s)": "Despite growing demand, the supply of highly skilled college graduates in the U.S. has not kept pace. In contrast to sluggish growth in the public sector, enrollment in for-profit institutions has grown rapidly over the last fifteen years. Yet little is known about the labor market return to a for-profit education. Do employers value credentials from some institutions more than others? We address these questions using a large-scale resume audit field experiment. We construct fictitious resumes, randomly vary the institution from which the job applicant received a degree or certificate, and apply to job vacancies that are posted on a large, national job search website. While our primary research question concerns employers’ valuations of a for-profit versus public credential, we also test the impact of having any credential for job vacancies that do not require it. Additionally, our planned sample size allows us to examine heterogeneity by occupation, degree, and labor market. In this pre-analysis plan, we describe the structure of the experiment, and we present early results from a pilot version of our study. The full version of the study went into the field on Monday, March 31st and will conclude by the end of November 2014. ",

The services collapsed one year later when the exporter stopped buying from DrumNet because farmers could not meet new EU production requirements.

After being organized into groups of five, which were jointly liable for individual loans taken out, individuals in the Treatment-Credit group received an in-kind loan from a local agriculture supply store. Individuals in a \"Treatment-NoCredit\" group received the same DrumNet package, only without the opportunity for credit.  At harvest time, for individuals in both treatment groups, DrumNet negotiated prices with an exporter and arranged a produce pickup. Once the produce was delivered to the exporter, the exporter payed DrumNet who, after deducting any loan repayments, credited the remainder to the individual savings accounts that each farmer opened when they registered. \r",

Our research design allows us to distinguish the causal effect from providing agricultural credit along with the package, versus simply providing extension and marketing services without credit.

The Partnership Schools for Liberia (PSL) program will delegate management of 92 randomly assigned public schools to be operated free of charge to students by a variety of private organizations, both for-profit and non-profit. By comparing these PSL schools to regular government schools in the control group, we will test whether private management improves school management and teacher accountability as measured by absenteeism, time on task, and ultimately student performance. Complementary analysis will assess the sustainability, scalability, and relative cost-effectiveness of this PPP model, as well as its effects on equity through student composition and spillovers. \r",

    "Intervention(s)": "THE PARTNERSHIP SCHOOLS FOR LIBERIA (PSL) PROGRAM\r PSL is a contract-management public-private partnership (PPP). Specifically, the Liberian Ministry of Education (MoE) contracted multiple non-state operators to run existing public primary schools (PSL schools). Philanthropic donors provide these operators with funding on a per-pupil level. In exchange, operators are responsible for the daily management of the schools, and can be held accountable for results.\rPSL schools will continue to be free and non-selective public schools (i.e., operators are not allowed to charge fees or choose which students to enroll). PSL school buildings will remain under the ownership of the government. Teachers in PSL schools will be existing government teachers (i.e., public servants).  Private providers will be accountable to the government for performance. Specifically, operators must agree to school inspections and provide the necessary data to evaluate performance. However, formal mechanisms holding operators accountable for student performance are not yet finalized.\r An important feature of PSL schools, compared to traditional charter schools, is that teachers in these schools will be civil servants. This hampers the operators’ ability to hold teachers accountable for learning outcomes and raises the question of whether this type of “soft” accountability will affect teachers' behavior.\r",
    "Intervention (Hidden)": "",
    "Intervention Start Date": "2016-09-05",
    "Intervention End Date": "2019-06-30",
    "Primary Outcomes (end points)": "Access to schooling (i.e., enrollment rates in communities with and without PSL schools)\rLearning outcomes of students\rTeacher behavior (e.g., absenteeism, time on task, use of corporal punishment, and teachers' job satisfaction and turnover rates)\rSchool management (e.g, monitoring visits, support and training for teachers, investment in school infrastructure and materials, and extra-curricular activities)\rParental engagement in education (e.g., expenditure on education and involvement in school activities)\rEquity, as measured by the socio-economic composition of students who access PSL schools\rEquity, as measured by spillover effects on nearby non-PSL schools \r",
    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "We hypothesize that the success of the program will hinge on its ability to maintain or improve three key accountability relationships in the education system.\r MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTABILITY (OF TEACHERS TO PRIVATE OPERATORS)\rA central hypothesis underlying Liberia's charter school program is that private operators with greater capacity to implement routine performance management systems, regularly monitor teacher attendance, track student performance, and provide teachers with frequent feedback and support will help to overcome teacher absenteeism and low education quality. \rThis is not a story about accountability through carrots and sticks. Teachers in Liberia's charter schools will be drawn from the existing pool of unionized civil servants with lifetime appointments, and be paid directly by the Liberian government. Private operators will have limited authority to request that a teacher be re-assigned, and no authority to promote or dismiss civil service teachers. The hypothesis is that accountability can be generated through monitoring and support, rather than rewards and threats.\rNote that this hypothesis stands in stark contrast to standard labor economics theories of accountability in the workplace which have dominated the economics of education literature in developing countries. These theories stress civil service protections and labor unions as impediments to accountability (Mbiti, 2016). In response, the experimental literature has focused on solutions such as payment for performance (Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2011) and flexible labor contracts with credible threat of dismissal (Banerjee et al., 2007; Duflo, Dupas &amp; Kremer, 2011; Duflo, Dupas &amp; Kremer, 2012; Duflo, Hanna &amp; Ryan, 2012).  \rWe will measure the effectiveness of Liberia's 'softer' approach to managerial accountability through the randomized control trial, comparing teachers in treatment (i.e., charter) and control schools. \r BOTTOM-UP ACCOUNTABILITY (OF TEACHERS AND OPERATORS TO PARENTS)\rIn the framework of the World Bank's 2004 World Development Report on public service delivery, there is a \"short route\" to accountability (i.e., bypassing the \"long route\" through elected representatives and the Ministry of Education) if parents are able to exercise \"client power\" in their interactions with teachers and schools. Client power emerges from freedom to choose another provider or direct control over school resources. \r Internationally, the charter school movement is closely tied to policy reforms bestowing parents with freedom of school choice. The standard argument is that charter schools will be more reactive to parents’ demands than traditional public schools, because their funding is linked directly to enrollment numbers. However, there is limited empirical evidence establishing that school choice responds to learning quality in low-income settings (Andrabi, Das &amp; Khwaja, 2008), and this mechanism may be more relevant for schools in high density locations like Monrovia than remote rural areas where choice is de facto limited to one or two schools in walking distance. Furthermore, since charter operators’ earnings are directly proportional to the number of enrolled children, it is in their best interest to increase enrollment, and retain enrolled children in their schools.\r TOP-DOWN, RESULTS-BASED ACCOUNTABILITY (OF PRIVATE OPERATORS TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION)\rCharter school operators' contracts can be terminated if they do not achieve certain pre-established standards. In the U.S. literature, this is generally referred to as a \"results-based accountability\" structure for charter schools. Operators are given a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and targets for each school. The government expects operators to meet this targets, but has not made it clear what the consequences for operators area if they do not meet these targets. \r To investigate these questions, the evaluation will collect survey data from parents, teachers, and students to measure both intermediate inputs (e.g., school management, teacher behavior, parental engagement), and final outcomes (i.e., student learning outcomes). We collect data on intermediate factors to provide insights into why PSL schools did or did not have an impact. ",
    "Secondary Outcomes (end points)": "",
    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "",
    "Experimental Design": "There are eight partners in charge of implementing the program’s pilot, all chosen by the government. In the first pilot year (2016/2017), BRAC is managing 20 schools, Bridge International Academies 22, the Liberia Youth Network 4, More than Me 6, Omega Academies 19, Rising Academies 5, Stella Maris 4, and Street Child 12.\r Based on criteria established by the evaluation team, MoE, and operators, 185 PSL-eligible schools were identified.  92 schools across 12 counties were randomly selected for treatment.  Each treated school will be administered by one of the eight private operators. Since each operator has different criteria for the schools they are able to administer, each school submitted a set of criteria necessary for their schools. Based on these criteria, the universe of 185 experimental schools was split into 8 mutually exclusive groups corresponding to the 8 operators, with each operator’s group containing twice the number of schools that operator will manage. Within each of these groups, half of the schools were randomly chosen to be treated, with the rest serving as controls.\r Since the composition of students may change across PSL and control schools in response to treatment assignment, we will sample students from 2015/2016 enrollment logs, which was created prior to community awareness about PSL intervention. Each student will be evaluated as part of her/his “original” school, regardless of what school (if any) s/he attended in subsequent years. Using this panel dataset, we can recover the effect of PSL schools under an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) framework. Under some assumptions, we can use instrumental variables to recover the Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT)\r",

    "Minimum detectable effect size for main outcomes (accounting for sampledesign and clustering)": "Using data from 2015 EGRA/EGMA assessments in Liberia, we estimate that the intra-cluster correlation in student’s test scores ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 for different grades and skills (with most estimates between 0.15 and 0.25). For all power calculations we use a conservative estimate of ICC at 0.2. Similarly, we estimate the proportion of the variance that is explained by observable characteristics (age, gender, district, and grade) to be between 20-30% (without including baseline test scores). Thus, for all power calculations we conservatively assume that the R-squared of observable student characteristics is 30%.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the minimum detectable effect size (MDE) with a power of 90%, at a 5% size, testing 10 students per school (in a total of 185 schools – 92 treated) is 0.22 standard deviations (Duflo, Glennerster &amp; Kremer, 2007). Testing 20 students per school, we have an MDE of 0.2. These MDE are estimated under very conservative assumptions (high power, low size level, and conservative ICC and R2 from observable student/school characteristics).\r\n\r\nAccording to EGMA data from 2015, students in third grade are able to answer, on average, 33.7% of addition questions correctly. Increasing test scores by 0.2 standard deviations would be equal to increasing the average test score from 33.7% to 37.4%. \r\n",

Using rich experimental data on household treatment-seeking behavior in Kenya, we study the implications of this trade-off for subsidizing life-saving antimalarials sold over-the-counter at retail drug outlets. We show that a very high subsidy (such as the one under consideration by the international community) dramatically increases access, but nearly one-half of subsidized pills go to patients without malaria.

    "Intervention(s)": "Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are now the only effective drugs in many malaria-endemic regions. In Kenya they are available in government clinics and retail drug stores. Public health clinics are often out of stock while the drug is unaffordable for the poor at full retail price. Subsidizing the drugs at the retail level can make the drug affordable but at the risk of over-treatment. The study attempts two interventions to test the trade-off between overtreatment and underteatment with ACTs.\r Sample households are assigned to one of three treatment arms. In the first treatment arm, households received vouchers to purchase ACTs at full price from their nearest drug store. In the second treatment arm, the ACTs are subsidized at 92%, 88% or 80%. In the third treatment arm, households received subsidized rapid diagnostic malaria tests (RDT) in addition to the ACT subsidies. \r In order to find out what fraction of people buying ACTs were truly malaria positive—a proxy for how well an ACT subsidy would be targeted—the researchers also selected a random subset of the households in all treatment groups to receive the offer of a “surprise” free RDT after they completed their transaction at the drug shop.\r",

    "Primary Outcomes (end points)": "The ultimate aim in this trial is to study how retail sector ACT subsidies impact both under-treatment (UT , the share of true malaria illnesses that are not treated with ACTs) and over-treatment ( OT , the share of non-malaria illnesses that are treated with ACTs). Since collecting the data to directly measure these outcomes was not logistically feasible, UT and OT are estimated indirectly by measuring:\r 1)\tAccess: the share of all illness episodes treated with an ACT\r2)\tTargeting: the share of ACT takers who are actually malaria positive\r",
    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "1) Access:  A malaria positivity index was created for all illness episodes, based on a symptoms database (N = 533) collected from the study population. During unannounced home visits, trained surveyors asked if anyone was feeling ill, and if yes, they collected information about symptoms (using the same survey instrument used in the endline survey and then tested the patient for malaria with an RDT. This data is then used to impute a malaria probability to the universe of illness episodes enumerated at endline and all illnesses observed at drug shops.\r 2) Targeting: A subsample of those redeeming the ACT voucher are administered a “surprise RCT” unless they are part of the ACT+RDT treatment arm and had already redeemed their RDT voucher prior to getting their ACT.\r",
    "Secondary Outcomes (end points)": "",
    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "",
    "Experimental Design": "Four rural drug stores, in a rural market setting, were selected. All households within a 4 km radius catchment area were sampled at baseline. At the end of the survey, the household was informed of its treatment status (full price ACT, ACT subsidy or ACT+RDT subsidy) and a voucher given accordingly. Each household was given two vouchers for ACT and two for RDT (if applicable) that could be redeemed at the study drug store. The drug dispensed was specific to the age of the patient. All ACTs and RDTs were provided by trained study officers posted at the drug shop for the duration of the study.\r Additionally, to test what proportion of patients buying ACT was actually positive for malaria, a random subsample was given the option of a free RDT test after they had redeemed their ACT voucher. If the patient had not come to the drug store, the officer went to the patient’s home to administer the test. During the endline survey, administered about four months after the vouchers were distributed, households were informed the study was ending and all vouchers were collected back.\r",

From the remaining suitable springs, 200 were randomly selected (using a computer random number generator) to receive protection. The water quality improvement construction was done by partner NGO, International Child Support, over a period of four years. Springs completed in round 1 and round 2 were considered treatment springs and the rest comparison. This resulted in 91 treatment and 93 comparison springs in the final sample.\r Users at each spring were asked to name others who also used the spring. When a household was named by two different respondents, it was designated as a “spring user”. Seven to eight households were randomly selected from the “spring user” list of each spring to be included in the sample. The baseline sample size was 1500 households.\r Data on spring water quality, household water quality and household health were collected 3-4 months after round 1 of spring protection, 1 year after round 2 of spring protection and five months after the second survey.\r",

The sample size estimation was based on the kebele-level randomization leading to comparisons of each treatment group with the control group.  \r\nWe conducted the power calculations for ANCOVA models, adjusting for autocorrelation from baseline to endline. For HAZ, we assumed an autocorrelation of 0.7. For nutrition knowledge and a household’s food gap we assumed no autocorrelation. We used conventional levels and set the power at 80 percent and the significance level at 0.05. The calculations suggested that a sample of 196 kebele clusters was needed, with 18 households per cluster, for an intended sample of 3,528 households.  In this sample, for HAZ, the minimum detectable effect (MDE) size is 0.34 SD; for mother’s nutrition knowledge it is roughly 1.0 point on a mean score of 7.51; and for the food gap, it is 0.89 months from a mean of 2.35 months. Details about the power calculations are also available in the baseline report.\r\n",

        "Abstract": "There is evidence that cash transfers reduce intimate partner violence (IPV), but less is known about the impacts of public works and complementary programmes on IPV. Using mixed-methods we examined whether and how the Ethiopian government's public works programme (that includes cash and/or food for work) alongside complementary activities that engage women and men affected IPV. We analysed midline data collected in July–October 2019 from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to measure the added impacts of the complementary programming in the Amhara and Oromia regions. Eligible households for this analysis had at least one child aged 0–35 months and a primary female caregiver who was married, and under 50 years-old (n = 2604). A nested qualitative study was conducted with a sub-sample of RCT participants from February–March 2020; data included seven focus group discussions and 58 in-depth interviews. Male partners of women who reported experiencing IPV were purposively sampled. Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses were used to estimate the average treatment effect of the complementary programming, and sub-analyses were conducted on the poorest ten households from each village who received additional livelihood transfers. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis. We found no impacts of the complementary programming on IPV in the full sample, but some impacts among the poorest sample. Evidence on pathways found that both the public works and complementary programming decreased poverty-related stress and arguments within relationships and increased emotional wellbeing. There were some impacts on women's empowerment from the complementary programming. However, men's reactions to women's empowerment were mixed. There was strong evidence that engaging men in nutrition behaviour change communication contributed to improving gender relations. Our findings indicate that social protection and complementary programmes have the potential to be gender transformative and prevent the drivers of IPV.",

        "Abstract": "Poultry has gained renewed attention as a promising value chain for women because it is an asset that is widely accessible to women, has low start-up costs, and provides a good source of nutritious animal-sourced foods for children in chicken meat and, especially, eggs. The current study presents evidence from an experimental intervention that randomly provided women either a poultry package transfer of vaccinated, improved-breed chickens and related inputs, or a cash grant of equivalent value within a sample of households participating in a social safety net program. These transfers were embedded in a set of intensive livelihood and enhanced nutrition interventions as part of a broader experiment in rural Ethiopia. We assess the impact of the poultry package transfer as well as the enhanced nutrition intervention on the consumption of eggs by both children and adult women. We find that the poultry transfer increased the frequency of egg consumption as well as the sale of eggs, falling between the extreme of an autarkic household and one in which production decisions are fully separable from consumption choices.",

    "Abstract": "For the past 22 years, the Philippine government has attempted to increase graduation rates and facilitate employment through the Special Program for the Employment of Students (SPES), which links low-income youth ages 15-25 to formal work opportunities lasting 20-52 days at decent wages during their school breaks by offering employers a 40% wage subsidy and facilitating the matching process. This program currently serves more than 150,000 students annually, but to date its effectiveness is unknown. \r The impact evaluation of the DOLE Special Program for the Employment of Students (SPES), is a partnership between DOLE, 3ie and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), aiming to design, implement and evaluate the impact of SPES on academic outcomes, youth employability and labor market perceptions. The evaluation is conducted Leigh Linden (University of Texas at Austin), Emily Beam (National University of Singapore), Stella Quimbo (University of the Philippines) and Nathanael Goldberg (Innovations for Poverty Action), with the coordination of IPA Philippines.\r We propose a large-scale randomized field experiment to assess the effectiveness of SPES. Specifically, we suggest using an oversubscription randomized control trial. With our help, SPES will conduct a large outreach effort to recruit more applicants than available positions in the program. From the pool of applicants, we will then randomly choose individuals to fill the available slots. We will compare the future behavior of applicants in the medium-term (12 months later) by comparing those chosen for the program to those who were not. \rThe primary focus of the evaluation will be to assess the effects of SPES on students’ school participation and labor market outcomes. School participation will include whether students are enrolled and obtain passing grades. Labor market outcomes will include income, work hours, and job-search effort and duration.\r Finally to provide guidance on the best strategies for matching applicants with positions, we plan to assess how the type of work experience students obtain affects their later enrollment decisions and employment outcomes. Work experience specific to students’ experience and interests may lead to greater program take-up and retention, larger impacts on school enrollment, and a faster transition to employment upon exiting school. Alternatively, the combination of earnings with general work experience, regardless of the nature of the work, may be the main determinant of students’ outcomes. This may be particularly true if exposing students to different work areas provides them with information and exposure to new career opportunities. ",

The objectives of SPES are to: augment income to cover the costs of education through an employment bridging program; keep youth in school and finish education where employers pay 60% of the beneficiaries and government (through DOLE) pays 40%; and increase school retention and graduation rate of the target beneficiaries. For 20-52 working days, students and out-of-school youth (OSY) who are 15-25 years old may apply for SPES, provided they are poor but deserving students who want to pursue education. To participate in the program, family income (including the applicant’s) may not exceed the regional poverty threshold for a family of six (6); the applicant must have obtained an average passing grade during the previous term or school year; the applicant must show good moral character as certified by the Barangay Chairman in their area; and the applicant must intend to enroll in any secondary, tertiary or tech-vocational educational institution.",

This initial lottery will exempt a small number of applicants who have previously participated in SPES. For all applicants, including those exempt from the initial lottery, we will work with the implementing partners to randomly assign accepted applicants to available jobs, subject to applicants meeting any job requirements set for each position. Those in the control group will be prohibited from joining SPES for one year. We will then randomly select a subset of control and treatment group students to be a part of our study, aiming for equal division on average between treatment and control groups to maximize power. Based on power calculations, 4,000 will be assigned to control and 4,000 to treatment. The exact treatment-to-control ratios and the ratio of sample size to number of applicants will vary at the municipal level because the oversubscription rate will also vary.

With a conservative response rate of 70%, a total sample size of 8,000 applicants, with 4,000 assigned to the treatment group and 4,000 to the control group will thus enable us to detect an average 2.9 percentage-point increase in enrollment with 90% power.

We will stratify the treatment assignment by neighbourhood and our main outcome variable.\rWe will have two additional experimental exercises. In one of these, we will randomize the timing of the follow-up calls to participants. This will generate exogenous variation in the amount of days that an individual has to wait to be called since receiving a payment, which will allow us to investigate how reporting varies with the time passed since receiving the aid payments. In the other exercise, we will assess the extent to which experimenter demands play a role in our setting. To do so, we will randomize whether participants receive a short message stating what we are expecting to see in our results (improvements in measures of need) when completing one round of follow-up surveys or not. We will then compare the results between “primed” and “non-primed” participants.\r",

        "Abstract": "Can digital payments help reduce extreme hunger? Humanitarian needs are at their highest since 1945, aid budgets are falling behind, and hunger is concentrating in fragile states where repression and aid diversion present major obstacles. In such contexts, partnering directly with governments is often neither feasible nor desirable, making private digital payment platforms a potentially useful means of delivering assistance. We experimentally evaluated digital payments to extremely poor, female-headed households in Afghanistan, as part of a partnership between community, nonprofit, and private organizations. The payments led to substantial improvements in food security and mental well-being. Despite beneficiaries' limited tech literacy, 99.75% used the payments, and stringent checks revealed no evidence of diversion. Before seeing our results, policymakers and experts are uncertain and skeptical about digital aid, consistent with the lack of prior evidence on digital payments for humanitarian response. Delivery costs are under 7 cents per dollar, which is 10 cents per dollar less than the World Food Programme's global figure for cash-based transfers. These savings can help reduce hunger without additional resources, demonstrating how hybrid partnerships utilizing digital payment platforms can help address grand challenges in difficult contexts.",

    "Abstract": "The Becoming One program is a skills-based curriculum designed for faith leaders to use with couples in their congregation seeking counseling prior to or following a wedding. The curriculum uses a biblical framework to communicate about practical skills for improving communication, emotional regulation, shared control over financial resources, financial planning, and sexual consent and pleasure. Faith leaders lead the participatory sessions with groups of couples, asking both members of the couples to attend together. The 12 total sessions are intended to be delivered once a week with each session lasting approximately 90 min. At the heart of the Becoming One intervention is the idea that individuals and couples will change their behavior when they are already self-motivated to do so, and when the source of advice or counsel is a person of social, religious, or political significance for them.\r This study measures the effect of the Becoming One (B1) program through a block-randomized control trial. There are three waves of measurement: a pre-randomization baseline, a midline survey approximately five weeks after the \"intervention\" group has completed the couples counseling program, and an endline survey approximately one year after the \"intervention\" group has completed the program, but before the \"comparison\" group has gone through couples' counseling.\r The random assignment works by forming couples into pairs within congregations (groups organized by the faith leaders) by matching on their baseline levels of physical violence, and then randomizing one couple in each pair to the intervention group, and one couple to the comparison group. The baseline levels of physical violence include an average of six binary indicators (standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) for whether the woman in the couple reports having been pushed, slapped, arm-twisted / hair-pulled, punched, kicked, or choked over the preceding 12 months. \r The main analyses of the experiment take place at the couple-level. We will construct non-parametric p-values calculated using randomization inference. Using simulation, we will report the alphas (type 1 error risks) one would need to apply at the test-level in order to reject at least one test in the family of main analyses only 5% and 10% of the time, under the global null of no effect on any outcome for any unit.\r Our main estimator is a covariate-adjusted estimator below, which, in addition to conditioning on an indicator for the treatment assignment and block-level fixed effects, adjusts for  predictive covariates using a mean-centering and interaction approach described in Lin (2013). For each outcome, we use a cross-validated Lasso estimator to select only those covariates that are predictive of the outcome, irrespective of whether those covariates are imbalanced. We justify this approach through a simulation study.\r We expect to encounter two-sided non-compliance in this study. For our main analyses, our estimand is an intent-to-treat (ITT) effect.\r To reduce the number of tests we are running, our main analyses focus on four outcomes that combine many theoretically-related measures:\r   1. Intimate Partner Violence: a binary indicator that is 1 if the female partner has experienced any of ten types of physical or sexual violence over the five months preceding the midline survey, and 0 otherwise. We expect that the ITT effect is negative and so will conduct a one-sided test of the null hypothesis of zero or positive effects.\r   2. Control and Decision-Making: an index of several groups of items, each of which is coded to vary between 0 and 1. The groups include decision-making about household finances and purchasing decisions, financial control, and social control. When at 0, this implies the female experiences all forms of financial and social control, and both partners perceive her to be excluded from all decision-making. When it is at 1, this implies the female partner does not report experiencing any forms of financial or social control, and is involved in all aspects of decision-making. We expect that the ITT effect is positive, and will conduct an upper-tailed test of the null hypothesis of zero or negative effects.\r   3. Sexual Consent and Autonomy: an index of items, mostly answered by the female partner but one answered by the male partner, about whether the male takes a non-coercive strategy when his partner refuses sex, and how the female partner feels about her control over decisions about and initiation of sex. The responses are coded to vary between 0 and 1. When the index is at 0, this implies that the female partner reports sexual coercion across all of the domains, and that the male partner reports coercive behavior. When it is at 1, this implies the absence of coercion.\r   4. Communication and conflict management techniques. An index of items addressing a broad range of domains of communication, answered by both female and male partners. The domains include communication about sex, about daily events and companionship, and techniques for de-escalation when arguing about difficult topics. When the index is at 0, this implies that the partners agree that they have had no supportive or open communication or techniques for peaceful or de-escalating communication across many domains. When it is at 1, this implies the partners agree that they communicate with supportive or open communication or techniques for peaceful or de-escalating communication across all the domains.\r We will base our main confirmatory inferences on these four outcomes, which also constitute the family of tests for which we will construct multiple comparison-adjusted alphas as above. \r In order to explain why these outcomes move, we will report and describe treatment effects graphically by plotting point estimates on the underlying items. We also have a range of secondary analyses that target either variables that we expect mediate the effect of B1 on these four outcomes, or other outcomes that are not of primary interest. All of these will be reported as analyzed, possibly in an appendix. We will note departures from the analysis plan, and label tests as pre-registered or not.\r",

    "Intervention(s)": "FOR MORE DETAILS SEE PAP\r Intimate partner violence (IPV) is thought to touch the lives of 30% of women globally and over 44% of married women living in rural Uganda.  Efforts to reduce rates of abuse often seek to effect radical normative change through intervention by outside actors.  Despite concerns that outside actors often lack legitimacy with local communities, there is comparatively little research on the capacity to reduce violence from within by working with local authority figures. \r In 2016, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) Research and Development team began prototyping intervention ideas for the Becoming One (B1) intervention in Liberia. The design team started off with extensive field research to better understand perceptions of different factors relating to intimate partner violence (IPV) as well as existing strategies that communities employ to address IPV. This work identified pastors and other faith leaders as particularly influential sources of authority over a couple’s behavior. \r Based on feedback from pastors and the World Vision team, IRC created an initial set of couples counselling prototypes, which could be used in pre-marital counselling by faith leaders. After many iterations based on feedback from both faith leaders and couples, the team conducted a small 8 week pilot in Gulu, Uganda with 40 faith leaders and approximately 900 couples in September and October of 2017. Observations and interviews suggested that framing relationship skills as based in “biblical principles,” seemed to increase the acceptance  and practice of new skills. Additionally, providing faith leaders with new counseling methods through instructional videos was an efficient way for many of the faith leaders to digest and then replicate novel approaches. \r  The purpose of this research protocol is to provide a rigorous assessment of the potential of the Becoming One program to improve couples’ communication and financial transparency, sexual agency for women and other markers of relationship quality.\r Through our evaluation of the effectiveness of Becoming One, we also seek to contribute to understanding the causes of intimate partner violence and intrahousehold conflict more generally. \r Theory of change\r At the heart of the Becoming One intervention is the idea that individuals and couples will change their behavior when 1) they are already self-motivated to do so, and 2) when the source of advice or counsel is a person of social, religious, or political significance for them. \r Put in the negative, Becoming One does not attempt to 1) create a motivation to change one’s relationship within couples who have not already expressed some amount of interest in change, or 2) influence couples or individuals using a source of authority external to their pre-existing social networks or community. \r What theories justify this approach? Behavioral science theories suggest that behavior change is more likely when interventions seek to allow pre-existing motivations to be expressed, as opposed to when they seek to create a new motivation from scratch (e.g., Prentice &amp; Miller, 2012). Interventions might help pre-existing motivations to be expressed by making it easier to achieve goals (through reminders, forms of social or logistical assistance), or by clarifying ways in which people can achieve goals (through simplified instructions, using culturally relevant explanations or symbols). Becoming One is based on these theoretical principles because it recruits couples who are already interested in religious couples counseling as a first step to getting married (individuals and couples have a pre-existing motivation to examine their relationship), and because Becoming One’s instruction is delivered in the language of religious text (which clarifies ways for couples to develop skills in their relationship using a familiar and revered system of belief) and in couples counseling classes with their peers (which makes it easier for couples to change with peer examples and support). \r A second set of social and behavioral theories that justify the Becoming One approach posit that patterns of behavior for individuals and communities are influenced to a relatively large degree by individuals with cultural, religious, social, or political significance or authority (e.g., Rogers &amp; Catano, 1965; Watts &amp; Dodds, 2007). These theories identify “key” influencers as important for activating individual changes in behavior, and under some circumstances, triggering critical mass changes in behavior within communities (e.g., Centola, 2018; Paluck, Shepherd &amp; Aronow, 2016). Becoming One is based on this broad theoretical assertion, because it operates through the influence of faith leaders, who have high status within the Ugandan communities under study, and who are regularly consulted by community members on social and religious matters, including conflicts within households. \r We use these basic theories to justify the design of Becoming One, and to predict that participation in the couples counseling will change individual behavior and interactive couple behavior in four primary ways. Becoming One should: \r Change couple dynamics through the Becoming One curriculum instruction and example of faith leaders, specifically: \r 1. Shift couple dynamics that represent zero-sum power struggles over finances, movement and general decision-making, resulting in a more equal balance of power in the couple,  \r2. Increase the use of skills within couples that do not relate to zero-sum power struggles, involving communication and conflict management techniques. \r Reduce violence, through the Becoming One curriculum instruction and example of faith leaders, specifically: \r 3. reduce intimate partner violence (physical and sexual),\r4. increase sexual autonomy and affirmative consent to sex within couples.\r On a global level, we predict that these changes will occur because the Becoming One curriculum is delivered by a religious local influencer, the messages encouraging these behaviors will be framed and justified by religious texts, and they will be delivered within the context of peer groups. For this reason, we will collect data (outlined below) to measure the fidelity of program delivery (via program monitors) and to measure treatment participants’ reactions to religious ideas, and perceptions of the peers in their Becoming One group (via a midline and baseline survey). In the survey, we plan to measure effects on a number of potential mediators of the outcomes of Becoming one, described below, in addition to these global predictors of change. They include individuals’ gender attitudes and perceived norms of the community, men's levels of emotional regulation, greater gender-equitable interpretation of religious scripts, increased financial transparency in the couple, couples’ convergence in trust and communication, and individuals’ definitions of violence.\r We also predict a number of secondary outcomes from this program related to the primary outcomes, detailed below. These include the degree of convergence in a couple regarding their beliefs about and perceptions of the relationship, a shifted distribution of domestic labor, lowered levels of emotional violence and of incidence of arguments, greater communication about sexual practices, and greater levels of time spent together; on an individual level, shifted perceptions of community norms regarding intimate partner violence, lowered levels of individual depression, and higher levels of confidence in expressing opinions publicly and in perceived social support. As a secondary outcome, we also plan to test separately the effect of Becoming One on different kinds of intimate partner violence, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence. \r Faith leaders\r The faith leaders recruited to deliver the Becoming One program completed one or two video-based trainings that prepared them to lead couples in sessions designed to develop practical skills for reducing IPV. During the training they received a faith leader guide, couples guides, an attendance and planning log, marketing materials, “I love my wife/husband” bracelets, and a tablet with copies of the videos and additional instructional materials in a branded bag to help them jump start and administer the program. They were also connected with other faith leaders who would be leading Becoming One sessions and were invited to join a WhatsApp group where they could share insights and learn from one another as they implemented the program.\r Becoming One syllabus \r The Becoming One program includes a skills-based curriculum which is meant to provide couples with practical skills for improving communication, emotional regulation, shared control over financial resources, financial planning, and sexual consent and pleasure. Sessions are meant to be participatory with the couples often asked to complete interactive activities together. Each couple is also given a guide book with additional home practice activities that they are asked to complete and report back on during subsequent sessions.  The content of the program is infused with gender-equitable religious and biblical materials to inspire and reinforce concepts while also providing a relatable social frame though which to integrate them. The design materials also showcase aspirational couple identities through vivid photos of Ugandan couples. \r Number of sessions \r The Becoming One program is comprised of 12 sessions delivered once a week with each session lasting approximately 90 min. The groups were responsible for selecting a time and place that was convenient for them to meet. The sessions are organized into three thematic modules: communication, finance, and sex. These are preceded by an introductory session and the program concludes with a final ceremony in which the couples are recognized. ",

As a secondary outcome, we also plan to test separately the effect of Becoming One on different kinds of intimate partner violence, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence. ",
    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "SEE PAP.",
    "Experimental Design": "This study measures the effect of the B1 program through a block-randomized control trial. \rThere are three waves of measurement: a pre-randomization baseline, a midline survey approximately five weeks after the \"intervention\" group has completed the couples counselling program, and an endline survey approximately one year after the \"intervention\" group has completed the program, but before the \"comparison\" group has gone through couples' counselling.\r Every couple in the study is invited to participate in B1. Intervention and comparison groups are formed from the three \"cohorts\" that go through the program. Specifically, those randomly assigned to the first cohort of B1 go through the program before the midline and endline surveys, whereas those assigned to the third cohort of B1 go through the program after the midline and endline. The design is not a typical \"stepped-wedge,\" insofar as the outcomes of the second cohort, who go through B1 some time after the midline but before the endline, are not directly measured as part of the main experimental comparison. Rather, the creation of a second cohort makes feasible the one-year delay between the baseline survey and the eventual entry of the third cohort into B1. ",
    "Experimental Design Details": "",
    "Randomization Method": "The random assignment works by forming couples into pairs within congregations by  matching on their baseline levels of violence, and then randomizing one couple in each pair to the intervention group (first cohort), and one couple to the comparison group (third cohort).\r Baseline violence was measured as follows: first, we clean the data and impute any missing items; second, we code six binary indicators for whether the woman in the couple reports having been pushed, slapped, arm-twisted / hair-pulled, punched, kicked, or choked over the preceding 12 months; third, we take the mean of these binary indicators, and standardize it to have mean 0 and standard deviation of 1.\r We form two-couple blocks within congregations using the blocktools algorithm in R. Some faith leaders were able to gather a bigger group than others, and some respondents recruited by faith leaders did not want to do the survey. However, the sample selection procedure described above ensures that each congregation has eight (n = 1), ten (n = 30), twelve (n = 77), or fourteen (n = 32) couples to randomize among (the numbers in parentheses indicate the frequencies of the different congregation sizes in the study). \r We create blocks and randomize within them using the following code in R:\r # Create blocks -----------------------------------------------------------\rblock_on &lt;- c(\"prop_physical_z\")\rbls &lt;- blockTools::block(\r  data = blwc,\r  n.tr = 2,\r  id.vars = \"cup_id\",\r  groups = \"fl_id\",\r  block.vars = block_on) \rblwc$blocks &lt;- createBlockIDs(obj = bls,data = blwc,id.var = \"cup_id\")\r # Randomize ---------------------------------------------------------------\rset.seed(5862007)\rblwc$Z &lt;- with(blwc, randomizr::block_ra(blocks = blocks, prob = .5))\r  ",

        "Abstract": "Violence committed by men against women in intimate relationships is a pervasive problem around the world. Patriarchal norms that place men as the head of household are often to blame. Previous research suggests that trusted authorities can shift perceptions of norms and create behavior change. In many settings, a compelling authority on behavior in relationships is religious leaders, who are influential sources of information about proper conduct in relationships and gatekeepers of marriage, but may also uphold traditional gender roles. One way leaders exert their influence is through premarital or couples counseling courses. In this study, we test whether, if given an opportunity to offer a more progressive religious interpretation of gender roles during these courses, religious leaders could motivate men to share power and thereby reduce violence. Building on existing faith networks of Christian religious leaders in western Uganda, we conducted a large pair-matched, randomized controlled trial among 1,680 heterosexual couples in which participants were randomized to attend a 12-session group counseling course or wait-listed. We find that the program shifted power from men to women and reduced intimate partner violence by five percentage points, comparable with more intensive secular programs. These improvements were largest among couples counseled by religious leaders who held the most progressive views at baseline and who critically engaged with the material. Our findings suggest that religious leaders can be effective agents of change for reducing violence.",

    "Experimental Design": "Under PRAF-II, a revamp of the first Programa de Asignación Familiar (PRAF), eligible families could receive two kinds of cash transfers. An education transfer of 812 Lempiras/year (about US$50) was available to families with children ages 6 to 12  who were enrolled and regularly attended grades 1-4. A health transfer of 644 Lempiras/year (about US$40)  was available to families with children under 3 and pregnant mothers who regularly attended health centers. In practice, school enrollment (but not attendance) was enforced as a condition of the payments, while no health benefits were suspended for failure to attend health centers.\r PRAF-II also planned to give cash transfers to schools and health centers of US$4,000 and US$6,000 respectively. However, the distribution of these funds was extremely limited in practice, mostly due to legal hurdles in forming community groups authorized to administer funds.  \r To target the program, municipalities were ranked based on average height-for-age scores of first graders, and the bottom 70 municipalities were selected for inclusion. The municipalities were then randomly allocated into four groups (as mentioned above under intervention details). For those municipalities in the treatment group, cash transfers were made available for children aged 6-12, who had not yet completed 4th grade. ",

    "Experimental Design": "Workers were first randomized into either the control group or one of two treatment groups: the detailed evaluation or the coarse evaluation treatment group. Randomization into any treatment group was stratified on prior oDesk experience, such that workers without oDesk experience had a higher chance of being in any treatment group (32 percent) than experienced workers (15 percent). Conditional on receiving any treatment, all workers had a 50 percent chance of receiving the detailed evaluation treatment. Inexperienced workers constituted approximately three quarters of each treatment group. \r The coarse evaluation treatment was designed to be equivalent to being hired (and, thus, evaluated) by a typical employer in the marketplace. The detailed evaluation treatment was identical to the coarse evaluation treatment except that it provided the market with more information about some workers’ job performance. Workers in both treatment groups were hired and given a maximum of ten hours over one week to enter the data. They were told that if, after spending ten hours on the task, they had not completed it, they should send the file back unfinished. The following objective measures of workers’ performance were used: their data entry speed, their error rate, the date they returned the data file, and three measures of whether they had followed the data entry instructions. All hired workers were rated on a one-to-five scale using a weighted average of workers’ scores on these performance measures. The distribution of scores from the job was designed to match the distribution of scores low-wage data entry workers received in the marketplace, adjusted for the fact that a worker in the sample was more likely to be inexperienced than a typical oDesk worker. The scores were calculated in the same way for workers in both treatment groups. Approximately 18 percent of workers did not return the file or log any hours. Under oDesk’s protocol, these workers were not rated. Thus, the treatments should be considered as an intent to hire. \r The particular treatment group to which workers were assigned affected only the type of comment workers were eligible to receive. No workers in either treatment group received a comment if they earned a rating below three. The remaining workers in the coarse evaluation treatment received an uninformative comment. The remaining workers in the detailed evaluation treatment received a detailed comment if they scored at least a four and an uninformative comment if they scored between three and four. Workers in the detailed evaluation treatment did not know that they would receive a detailed evaluation until it was posted.\r The uninformative comment was chosen to be short and positive, like most of the comments in the marketplace. The detailed comment provided objective information on the worker’s data entry speed and accuracy, whether the worker met the deadline, and whether she followed the job’s instructions. Additionally, it repeated the uninformative comment, so the only difference between the two comment types was the objective information provided in the detailed evaluation.",

Field trials of these technologies show substantial increases in yields, but are typically done on highly monitored experimental plots rather than by farmers themselves. We conducted a field experiment in southern Mali and randomly provided free fertilizer to female rice farmers to measure how farmers chose to use the fertilizer, what changes they made to their agricultural practices, and the profitability of these changes. We find that farmers who received fertilizer were more likely to use fertilizer, increased the quantity of fertilizer used on their plots, used more complementary inputs such as labor and herbicides and had increased yields. We however find no evidence of increase in agricultural profits.",

The experiment had two treatment groups: those who received the full recommended quantity of fertilizer per hectare, and those who received half of the recommended quantity per hectare. Farmers in the control group received no fertilizer. Teams were sent to the villages to distribute the fertilizer to women in the treatment groups. A short, 30-minute explanation on how to use the fertilizer was provided - no other training or monitoring was provided.

        "Abstract": "The learning crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is alarming. More than 80 percent of primary school‒age children are not mastering the basics of reading and math. A package of interventions to deliver remedial support for students through collaboration among parents, teachers, and community members was developed in Madagascar. The package was mainly composed of school management and pedagogical components, and each component comprises several interventions. This study investigated the effectiveness of the package using a randomized controlled trial. The package realized extra-curricular remedial activities for three to four months and improved learning outcomes in basic reading, and numbers and the four basic operations. The volume of students who could read a paragraph or story written in the local language increased by approximately 21 percentage points. Students also improved learning outcomes in numbers and the four basic operations by 0.40 standard deviations. Furthermore, the package decreased the repetition rate and increased the passing rate of the primary certification exam. The results demonstrate the power of community-wide support for children in education.",

    "Abstract": "The Wave I Ghana Financial Incentive trial confirmed that financial incentives have a positive effect on COVID-19 vaccine intentions, reported vaccination status and verified vaccination status. Wave II provides an opportunity to understand whether this financial incentive effect generalizes to other types of health behavior:  Does a similar financial incentive design with tuberculosis screening produce similar positive results?  The Wave I trial was designed to identify any spillover effects across treatment arms or on untreated individuals within treated communities.  We found no evidence of negative spillover effects of cash incentives on individuals who received no cash compensations.  An unanswered question is whether the financial incentives affect within-subject behavior.  Wave II examines the willingness of those who received financial incentives in the initial TB screening treatment to adopt similar preventative health behaviors six months later.  Wave II is also designed to evaluate the relative impact of financial incentives compared to simple informational reminders.",

Due to the success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to re-select between the home and office.

Cash incentives have been proposed as a way to improve the efficiency and equity of the roll-out in Africa.  Recent experimental evidence suggests that financial incentives can promote the adoption of preventive health habits (Hussam etal 2022) and more specifically vaccine uptake (Campos Mercade etal 2021).  To evaluate whether cash incentives affect the willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine, we are undertaking a field experiment, designed and conducted in consultation with the University of Ghana and the Ghana Health Service.

    "Experimental Design": "This experiment sought to investigate whether Indonesia's current system of decentralized village-based decision-making suffers from elite capture, as well as the perceived legitimacy of this system. Each village was preparing to apply for infrastructure projects as part of the Indonesian Kecamatan Development Program (KDP). The experiment randomly allocated 49 Indonesian villages to choose their projects either through a standard KDP decision-making process, in which projects are selected at two representative village meetings (one meeting to select the general project, and one meeting exclusively with women representatives to select the women's project), or through direct plebiscites, in which all villagers could vote directly at an election for their most preferred projects. To mirror the meeting-based process, in plebiscite villages two simultaneous votes were held, one in which all adults in the village were eligible to vote for the general proposal and one in which all adult women in the village were eligible to vote on the women's-specific proposal. \r The experiment was conducted in two phases. First, Phase I was conducted in 10 villages in East Java Province and 19 villages in North Sumatra Province. Based on qualitative reports from Phase I areas, the experimental protocol was changed slightly, and then run again in Phase II in an additional 20 villages in Southeast Sulawesi Province. The impact on elite capture was evaluated by examining whether the types of projects chosen moved closer to the preferences of village elites and whether the location of projects moved towards wealthier parts of the villages. The impact on perceived legitimacy was evaluated by examining a wide range of measures of villagers' satisfaction with, and perceived fairness of, KDP. ",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of the study is to determine conditions under which participation by the community in the provision of the social services which the community needs improves access to those services. Access to services such as sanitation, health care and education remains inadequate for much of the world's population, including disadvantaged communities in the United States. No consensus exists about how to improve access to services. Many policy-makers, like the World Bank, have embraced the view that access to services would improve if users of services participated in providing those services, and more generally that local participation is necessary to improve the performance of all development projects. The hypothesis that users of services have more information about their needs and a greater interest in a good outcome than does a remote central organization is reasonable. However, local control can also lead to control by a few powerful people for their own benefit, a community may lack technical knowledge and may be unable to exploit economies of scale.  In this study, we implement three organizational interventions designed to provide access to safe drinking water in Bangladesh. In each type of intervention, the authority to make decisions regarding the provision of safe water will be allocated differently to test the hypothesis that community participation improves outcomes.

Another intervention will represent the opposite extreme on the spectrum of community participation. The NGO will ask the village residents to make all decisions. The third intervention is an intermediate one, in which the NGO restricts the way in which the village residents participate in the provision of safe water. Discussions with NGOs and case studies suggest testing an intervention which strives to achieve broad participation across socio­economic groups in planning and execution and requires public disclosure to the village of every decision made and identity of its supporters. \r A control group of villages will receive no intervention at all.

    "Abstract": "A large literature examines performance pay for managers in the private sector, but little is known about performance pay for managers in public sector bureaucracies. In this paper, researchers study performance incentives rewarding school administrators for reducing anemia among their students. This study is part of a larger randomized control trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” which was implemented in Northwest China. The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. It was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five performance incentive arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \r The study discussed in this paper focuses only Arms 1, 2, and 3. Randomly assigning 170 schools to three performance incentive levels and two orthogonal sizes of unconditional grants, researchers analyze performance pay and its complementarity with discretionary resources. They find that both large incentives and larger unconditional grants reduced anemia substantially, but incentives were more cost-effective. Performance incentives led administrators to innovate by working with parents, mitigating potentially offsetting compensatory behavior among households. Researchers also find that larger unconditional grants completely crowded-out the effect of incentives. Their findings suggest that performance incentives can be effective in bureaucratic environments – but also that discretionary resources can fully crowd-out their effect.\r The remaining 130 of 300 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M. (2015). “Multiple Tasks and Multiple Rewards: Experimental Evidence on Performance Incentives, Alignment and Complementarity from Chinese Schools.” Working paper).\r Note, the original trial was registered on October 12, 2012 in the J-Pal Hypothesis Registry because the AEA RCT Registry did not exist at that time (https://www.povertyactionlab.org/Hypothesis-Registry).\r",

Once schools were allocated to one of these treatment arms, the principal of each school receiving a small incentive, a large incentive, or no incentive for reducing anemia prevalence in their schools.\r Comparison group: In 65 schools, principals did not receive any incentive to reduce anemia; they received only budget support and information. (Arm 1 of the original trial)\r Large performance incentives: In 65 schools, principals received a larger incentive of 125 yuan (US$20) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. Under this incentive structure, it was feasible for principals in this group to earn incentives equivalent to two additional months of salary. (Arm 2 of the original trial)\r Small performance incentives: In 40 schools, principals received 12.5 Chinese yuan (US$2) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. (Arm 3 of the original trial)\r Across each of the three incentive groups, all schools were randomly assigned to receive small or large black grants in order to examine the effect of different amounts of resources on the prevalence of anemia. Although these funds were given in the context of the nutrition program, principals were free to reallocate them to other school functions, and receiving these funds did not depend on reducing anemia prevalence.",

    "Experimental Design": "This study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” In the original trial, researchers began with 36 counties officially designated by the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province, and Ankang in Shaanxi Province). In August 2011, researchers conducted a canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the number of students enrolled in each. Restricting the sampling frame to primary schools with 150-300 students total, they randomly selected 300 of 1,410 eligible schools for inclusion in the study (and limited selection to one school per township). The sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools in the same region of China. Within study schools, researchers randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students from each school (10-to-11-year-old students). Researchers chose these grades to select students sufficiently old to provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent. Researchers conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at baseline to obfuscate the focus on fourth and fifth graders.\r The original experiment was designed as a cluster-randomized trial using a 5x2 crosscutting design. After conducting the baseline survey, researchers provided all school administrators with information about anemia, and schools were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental cells. The five incentive groups arms were: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). The planned methodology and specifications for analyzing the impacts of the program are outlined in the Pre-Analysis Plan. Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \r This part of the study includes only Arm 1, referred to as Group A: a group without incentives; Arm 2, referred to as Group C: a “large” incentive group; and Arm 3, referred to as Group B: a “small” incentive group. As noted, each of these arms has two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group (Group 1: 85 schools; Group A1: 32 schools; Group B1: 20 schools; Group C1: 33 schools) and a “large” block grant group (Group 2: 85 schools; Group A2: 33 schools; Group B2: 20 schools; Group C2: 32 schools). The reference group is the default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no incentives, Group A1). To improve power, researches used stratified randomization. Using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, researchers randomized cell assignment within each stratum. This analysis takes this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects. \r In the large incentive group - Group C - researchers offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between the beginning and end of the school year, with 125 yuan (RMB) ($19.40) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., two months of a school administrator’s annual salary for a 50-percent reduction in anemia). Researchers did not reveal the identity of anemic students. The small incentive group - Group B - was identical to the Group C except that the incentive was 12.5 RMB ($1.95) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., 0.2 additional months of annual salary for 50-percent reduction in anemia). When school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (student identity was not revealed). Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the contract, one of which they kept). All interventions were implemented in partnership with local education bureaus, signaling that the project was sanctioned by local governments.\r The small block grant group - Group 1 - was 0.3 RMB ($0.05) per student per day for school administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant  - Group 2 - was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day. In total, Group 1 schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and Group 2 schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two installments (at the beginning of the program and half way through the school year). Although funds were given in the context of nutrition, administrators were free to allocate these to other school functions at their discretion.\r Prior to revealing treatment assignment, researchers provided health education about nutrition and anemia to all school administrators in the study. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011 and follow-up survey in May 2012 (i.e., at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed information on students, households, school administrators, and schools. As part of Student Surveys, researchers interviewed all sampled students at their schools, collecting information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities, and general health. Students were given standard food frequency questionnaires to collect information about food consumption at school and at home over the past week. Researchers measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site (at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems. As part of Household Surveys, for each sampled student, researchers collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be unlikely to know themselves. As part of School Administrator Surveys, researchers interviewed school administrators (bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Researchers also measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding of the training material. Through School Surveys, researchers collected basic information from schools (enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (teacher characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).\r For primary outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), researchers test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their interactions and three additional ones – that the small and large incentives have the same average effect, that the large incentive and the large block grant have the same average effect, and that the average effect of the large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero. Therefore researchers adjust p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993), which accounts for the dependency of the data. For secondary outcomes, researchers adjust p-values according to the total number of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five – the number of treatment coefficients in each regression). Secondary outcomes are behavioral responses underlying changes in primary outcomes (actions taken by administrators (provision of supplements or food and communication with households) and subsequent responses among students and their parents (student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its nutritional basis).\r Finally, researchers examine the cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination, considering both the sub-sample of children anemic at baseline and the full sample of children, and present both “programmatic” cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and social cost-effectiveness calculations. Researchers calculate total social costs as the sum of programmatic costs, the cost of public funds, and costs incurred by households in response to the interventions. \r As noted earlier, the full experiment involved 300 schools. The remaining 130 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M. (2015). “Multiple Tasks and Multiple Rewards: Experimental Evidence on Performance Incentives, Alignment and Complementarity from Chinese Schools.” Working paper).",

        "Abstract": "A large literature examines performance pay for managers in the private sector, but little is known about performance pay for managers in public sector bureaucracies. In this paper, researchers study performance incentives rewarding school administrators for reducing anemia among their students. Randomly assigning 170 schools to three performance incentive levels and two orthogonal sizes of unconditional grants, researchers analyze performance pay and its complementarity with discretionary resources. They find that both large incentives and larger unconditional grants reduced anemia substantially, but incentives were more cost-effective. Performance incentives led administrators to innovate by working with parents, mitigating potentially offsetting compensatory behavior among households. Researchers also find that larger unconditional grants completely crowded-out the effect of incentives. Their findings suggest that performance incentives can be effective in bureaucratic environments – but also that discretionary resources can fully crowd-out their effect.",

    "Experimental Design": "The fieldwork is designed to study the degree to which individual contributions towards purchasing soil fertility tests and accompanying management recommendations will differ depending on the actual and perceived heterogeneity across sampled plots – both in terms of geography and social networks. Specifically, we conduct a controlled field experiment based on the standard public goods game. We modify the game slightly: farmers decide how much to contribute towards the purchase of a soil fertility test and associated site-specific management recommendations. Farmers play several rounds of the game; in each round they bid on a soil fertility test from a different plot with each plot varying both in terms of geographic distance from the plot of the bidding farmer (geographic heterogeneity) and in terms of farmers’ knowledge of the plot and relationship with the plot’s owner (social networks heterogeneity). \r Our study builds on a 2014-2019 research project “Integrated Soil Fertility Management in Malawi” – an impact evaluation of an agricultural extension service in Central Malawi (Maertens, Michelson, and Nourani 2019). The 2014-2019 extension project was carried out in 250 randomly selected villages in two Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) where the implementer had not worked previous to 2014: Mthumtama in Kasungu district and Chibvala in Dowa district. Our project randomly selected 30 of the control villages from the 2014-2019 project villages: 15 in Kasungu district and 15 in Dowa district. In each village, based on the agricultural census obtained from the extension officers, we invited 20 farmers to take part in a public goods game. Only one farmer per household was allowed to participate. \r In addition to the public goods game, in order to benchmark our total contributions towards a soil fertility test, we elicited individual willingness to pay (WTP) for soil fertility information following the Random Lottery Incentive System (RLIS) method in four additional villages (two in Kasungu and two in Dowa), interviewing six individuals in each of the villages in their homes.",

Soil heterogeneity may both impede social learning and encourage experimentation. In our experiment, farmers contribute towards the purchase of a single soil test in the village in a threshold public goods game. This soil test provides farmers with valuable and actionable information. By randomly varying the plot selected for soil testing we establish the role of soil heterogeneity. We find that farmers contribute more when they perceive soils to be more similar to their own plot, but also free ride on others whose soils they perceive as similar. This free riding increases in larger groups of farmers with similar soils. Despite this, all villages consistently contribute enough to purchase the soil test.",

        "Abstract": "Home-visitation programs have improved child development in low- and middle-income countries, but they are costly to scale due to their reliance on trained workers. We evaluated an inexpensive and low-tech alternative with 2,433 caregivers of children aged 6 to 30 months served by 250 public childcare centers in Uttarakhand, India: automated phone calls offering parenting advice. The intervention was implemented largely as intended, with more than two-thirds of caregivers completing at least 10 calls. Yet, counter to expectations, it had negative but statistically insignificant effects on caregivers’ knowledge and interactions with their children, reduced their self-efficacy (by 0.11 standard deviations), and increased their anxiety (by 0.10 standard deviations). Consistent with this pattern, it had precisely estimated null effects on children’s development and language. An analysis of program materials suggests four reasons why the program may not have had the desired effects.",

    "Abstract": "This project involves randomised screenings of an aspirations-building film to secondary school students before their national exams. The film is called Queen of Katwe and is a biographical film, based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, about the rise of a poverty stricken Ugandan girl to become a world chess champion. The film therefore offers a potential role model to young Ugandan students about working hard to achieve their dreams and overcoming challenges. \r A growing body of behavioural economics research suggests that people’s aspirations and sense of control over their lives may be beaten down over time by the very difficult nature of living in poverty. Providing an example of a successful peer as a role model may help to create new mental models at a crucial decision point in young peoples’ lives. This research design allows us to test whether something as simple as viewing an aspirational film can positively impact young people’s educational achievement and hence have long run impact on their earning potential. It would allow us to answer the following questions:\r1.\tDoes the viewing of an aspirational film featuring a potential role model, The Queen of Katwe, positively impact students' national exam performance?\r2.\tDoes this impact vary by the gender or age of the viewer, or by the level of exam being sat?",

Students were individually randomised to see either a movie featuring a female role model, Queen of Katwe, or to see a placebo movie. I find that treatment with the role model immediately before an important national exam leads to students performing better in their exams, particularly in maths subjects, with effects largest for female students. Female students exposed to the role model are more likely to remain in education in subsequent years, closing the gender gap with their male peers.",

Since “Hypertension Days” are targeted towards patients with high blood pressure, our study sample consists of individuals above the age of 30 who are either diagnosed with or at risk of hypertension. We follow widely accepted medical guidelines and define hypertensive patients as those with systolic blood pressure above 140 or diastolic blood pressure above 90. To identify hypertensive individuals, a team of enumerators first screened all members of a particular household by measuring their blood pressure using an automatic blood pressure measurement device. If the systolic or diastolic blood pressure reading is above the thresholds previously described, the enumerator immediately invites the individual to participate in the study and to complete the baseline survey. In the event that more than one household member has hypertension, the member with the highest stage of hypertension (stage 1 or stage 2), is selected to take part in the study. Finally, in the event that more than one household member has the same hypertension stage, the member with the highest systolic blood pressure reading is selected to take part in the study. During the same household visit in which the baseline survey is administered, the respondent was offered a commitment contract or price discount coupons to visit the weekly “Hypertension Day” in their village for 3 times in 6 months, as described in the intervention section above. Note that before commencing the study, we conducted a census in all villages in our sample and collected data on household characteristics. We used this census data to randomize all households in the village prior to the enumerators’ visit. ",

        "Abstract": "Self-control problems constitute a potential explanation for the underinvestment in preventive health in low-income countries. Behavioral economics offers a tool to solve such problems: commitment devices. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of theoretically motivated commitment contracts in increasing preventive doctor visits by hypertensive patients in rural India. Despite achieving high take-up of such contracts in some treatment arms, we find no effects on actual doctor visits or individual health outcomes. A substantial number of individuals pay for commitment but fail to follow through on the doctor visit, losing money without experiencing health benefits. We develop and structurally estimate a prespecified model of consumer behavior under present bias with varying levels of naiveté. The results are consistent with a large share of individuals being partially naive about their own self-control problems: sophisticated enough to demand some commitment but overly optimistic about whether a given level of commitment is sufficiently strong to be effective. The results suggest that commitment devices may in practice be welfare diminishing, at least in some contexts, and serve as a cautionary tale about their role in health care.",

Farmers were compensated based on the number of trees that were still alive at each inspection.\r There were two different selection methods: auction and lottery. In the auction group, participants submitted bids for the minimum compensation for which they would participate in the program. Sealed bids were collected and ranked on the spot to determine the auction clearing price based on the available budget and the first rejected bid. Participants in the lottery group were told the take-it or leave-it price, based on the auction clearing price (but were not informed about the source of the price).The lottery was conducted among those participants who were willing to accept this price.",

        "Abstract": "PRIVATE INFORMATION AND THE ALLOCATION OF LAND USE SUBSIDIES IN MALAWI\r Efficient targeting of public programs is difficult when the cost or benefit to potential recipients is private information. This study illustrates the potential of self-selection to improve allocational outcomes in the context of a program that subsidizes tree planting in Malawi. Landholders who received a tree planting contract as a result of bidding in an auction kept significantly more trees alive over a three year period than did landholders who received the contract through a lottery. The gains from targeting on private information through the auction represent a 30 percent cost savings per surviving tree for the implementing organization.",

    "Abstract": "Effective democratic representation is closely connected to economic development, good governance, and political stability. However, accountability is often limited in the developing contexts where it is needed most. In light of the mixed evidence that information dissemination campaigns can support electoral accountability, we explore whether education complements or substitutes for information provision in pursuing this goal. To assess these claims, we are conducting a panel survey in Senegal around the July 2017 national legislative elections. Our design nests two sources of exogenous variation: quasi-experimental variation in access to free secondary schooling and randomized individual-level provision of legislator duty and performance information before the election. Such variation enables us to plausibly identify the effects of access to secondary education, information about deputy responsibilities, incumbent and benchmarked performance information, and their interactions on political engagement and electoral accountability. The surveys also explore the mechanisms underpinning these effects, helping us to speak to the broader question of whether and how education complements or substitutes for information provision in supporting electoral accountability, and ultimately democratic representation.",

    "Experimental Design": "To identify the interaction between education and information provision we combine natural variation with a randomized controlled trial. First, we leverage variation in school construction to identify the effects of access to education using a difference-in-differences (and instrumental variables) design that compares cohorts just too old to be affected by the reforms to cohorts affected by the reforms in villages that were and were not close to locations where new secondary schools were constructed. Second, we randomize the provision of incumbent performance information to individuals in those cohorts and villages. In addition, we compare the effects of just informing voters about their current incumbent with also providing a temporal benchmark---the performance of a previous incumbent. To further probe the conditions required to process and incorporate such information in voting decisions, we further vary whether voters are informed of the duties of their deputies. We conduct a panel survey to measure the pre-treatment effects of education, the effects of different types of information provision, and interaction between education and information provision on electoral accountability and several costly behavioral outcomes. A variety of treatment variants and survey questions help us to separate between the mechanisms potentially driving our main hypotheses relating to the effects of education, information provision, and their potential complementarity or substitutability on electoral accountability.",

        "Abstract": "Political accountability may be constrained by the reach and relevance of information campaigns in developing democracies and—upon receiving information—voters' ability and will to hold politicians accountable. To illuminate voter-level constraints and information relevance absent dissemination constraints, we conducted a field experiment around Senegal's 2017 parliamentary elections to examine the core theoretical steps linking receiving different types of incumbent performance information to electoral and nonelectoral accountability. Voters immediately processed information as Bayesians, found temporally benchmarked local performance outcomes particularly informative, and updated their beliefs for at least a month. Learning that incumbents generally performed better than expected, voters durably requested greater politician contact after elections while incumbent vote choice increased among likely voters and voters prioritizing local projects when appraising incumbents. In contrast, information about incumbent duties did not systematically influence beliefs or accountability. These findings suggest voters were able and mostly willing to use relevant information to hold politicians to account.",

Any absence had to be recorded on the register and approved by the supervising doctor to which the nurse reports to.\r Attendance was incentivized by an announcement by the Chief Medical Health Officer (CMHO) of the district which stipulated that ANMs absent for more than 50% of the time on monitored days would have their pay reduced by the number of absences recorded by Seva Mandir’s monitoring system for that month.

This paper studies how an\rinnovative risk management instrument for hedging rainfall risk affects\rproduction decisions among a sample of Indian agricultural firms,\rusing a randomized controlled trial approach. We find that the\rprovision of insurance induces farmers to shift production towards\rhigher-return but higher-risk cash crops, particularly amongst more educated\rfarmers. Our results support the view that financial innovation\rmay help mitigate the real effects of uninsured production risk. \r In a second experiment we elicit willingness to pay for insurance policies\rthat differ in their contract terms, using the Becker-DeGroot-Marshak\rmechanism. Willingness-to-pay is increasing in the actuarial value of\rthe insurance, but substantially less than one-for-one, suggesting a disconnect between what farmers may need and want. ",

    "Experimental Design": "The goal of this project was to study how access to an innovative retail risk management instrument influences \"real\" production decisions.  A randomized control trial approach was employed in which rainfall insurance was randomized across small agricultural firms in a semi-arid region of India in which rainfall variability during the monsoon is the primary source of production and income risk. At the start of the monsoon, the treatment group consisting of half of the farmers in the sample was provided with rainfall insurance policies, mitigating their exposure to rainfall risk. The control group was instead promised a fixed cash payment equal to an estimate of the actuarial value of the insurance policy, to be paid at the same time as insurance payouts. This compensation was offered to ensure that differences in behavior between the insurance and control group would be do to the state-contingent nature of the insurance, rather than any wealth effects arising from the expected value of the insurance. After the growing season, a follow-up survey was conducted of each household which collected demographic data, information on livestock, financial assets (including savings, loans, and insurance), agricultural investments and production decisions during the monsoon, and attitudes towards and expectations of weather and insurance payout, and risk-coping behavior. \r The project also involved a follow-up experiment which sought to understand how consumers value these complex insurance products and to provide insight into their long-run commercial viability. An interviewer would visit each household after the first experiment and offer the chance to participate in a game in which they would have the opportunity to purchase rainfall insurance policies at a discounted price. The subject would have a chance to study the details of several insurance policies, and then record, in rupees, their willingness to pay for it. Only one of these policies would in fact be available for sale, and would be revealed only after the subject had stated willingness to pay for all policies. If the subject's bid were greater than or equal to the offer price, the subject would purchase the policy. If the subject's bid was less than the offer price, no insurance policy would be sold. ",

They were originally selected via a stratified random sample of land-owning farms in 37 study villages in 2004.

For a period of 2.5 months, sevikas in all of the sampled AWCs (960 AWCs) will inform pregnant women in their first and second trimesters that they are eligible to register for our treatment, known as the “Poshan Pahal” scheme. Unlike some other government programs for pregnant women, there were no eligibility requirements, aside from stage of pregnancy. \r They will be informed that women in selected AWCs will received a year of monthly cash transfers of Rs. 500, where half of AWCs will be selected. Transfers are made into the bank accounts of the selected women and are not conditional on the actions of the women, since conditionality can create bottlenecks that slow transfers. In order to register, women need to supply their bank account information and fill out a simple form, where assistance was provided to women who did not currently have bank accounts. After the 2.5 months ended, women could no longer register for the scheme. Monthly transfers of Rs. 500 are then made into their bank accounts as described.",

    "Experimental Design Details": "After registration was complete, women were randomized into four groups, with transfers going out immediately. Figure 1 summarizes the experimental design. The entire sample of the study comprises of 960 AWCs randomly selected across 8 districts, from which we will choose the AWCs for the three treatment arms:\r •\tTreatment Group 1: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for two years, starting immediately after the registration window closes (approximately from ages -6 months to 18 months for the child)\r•\tTreatment Group 2: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for one year, starting immediately after the registration window closes (approximately from ages -6 months to 6 months for the child)\r•\tTreatment Group 3: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for one year, starting one year after the registration window closes (approximately from ages 6 months to 18 months for the child)\r•\tControl group: 240 AWCs will serve as the control group for the three treatments\r In the treatment arms, the cash transfers will be framed as to be used for maternal and child nutrition. This message will be reinforced by regular interactive voice response phone calls to beneficiaries. Control households will receive similar phone calls, but with a generic message encouraging spending on nutrition, to keep the role of messaging constant between the groups. Since households will be randomly assigned to these groups, we can compare between them to determine the relative effectiveness of getting transfers at different ages for child nutrition. The results will speak to broader questions around targeting cash transfers to mothers of young children, and the rate of return to expanding the fiscal envelope to increase spending on early childhood nutrition.\r",

    "Minimum detectable effect size for main outcomes (accounting for sampledesign and clustering)": "We surveyed the literature on cash transfers to gauge the range of plausible effect sizes that we want to be powered to detect. Transfers are around 15% of household income, similar in magnitude to those studied in Schady and Rosero (2008) and Paxson and Schady (2010) in Ecuador, Amarante et al (2011) in Uruguay, and Macours et al (2012) in Nicaragua. The most comparable is the Ecuadorian program, in which there was an improvement in development of 0.18 standard deviations among the poorest quartile of children in their sample; given the higher income levels in Ecuador, that group should be roughly comparable to our sample in Jharkhand. We wish to detect effects of that size for each of the questions of interest. To be slightly conservative, our calculations focus on minimum detectable effect sizes of 0.15 standard deviations. \r\n\r\nIntracluster Correlation Calculations\r\n\r\nSince our randomization is clustered at the AWC level, we must account for intracluster correlation in our power calculations. We use the 2006 wave of the Indian National Family Health Survey and calculate the intra-village correlation in child height and weight for age within villages in Jharkhand and neighboring states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa). For these variables, the intracluster correlation is relatively high, at 0.06 and 0.09. To be conservative, we use 0.09 in our calculations. \r\n\r\nNumber of Participants Per Cluster\r\n\r\nThe average number of women per AWC is estimated to be 5, but in the first round of registrations, we observed substantial heterogeneity across AWCs. In some clusters, there were as many as 17 women registered, while in others, none registered. We calculate the coefficient of variation in number of registrations across AWCs (0.665), and take this into account in the power calculations. When we randomize, we will also stratify by number of registrations in an AWC to maximize power.\r\n\r\nOne way of increasing power is to collect baseline data on variables that will be correlated with the outcome at endline (such as the outcome at baseline). We have elected not to do a baseline survey. There are two reasons that we will not be able to do this. First, it is not possible to identify beneficiaries until after they have registered, and the transfers must go out as soon as possible after registration. This does not afford time for a baseline survey. Second, the primary outcomes of interest, such as child weight and height are not possible to measure at baseline, since the child is still in utero. In the power calculations, we thus do not assume any power boost from a baseline survey.\r\n\r\nThe power calculations are different for each of the questions of interest. For example, to calculate the effect of a single year of cash transfers, we can combine the two treatment groups that receive a year of transfers and compare them to the control group. However, to determine the effect of receiving two years of transfers, we can only compare that single treatment group to the control group. For all of the questions of interest, we seek to detect an effect of 0.15 standard deviations with 80% power. We thus determine our sample size for the questions on which the sample sizes will be smallest, and then calculate our power for the other questions of interest under this sample size.\r\n\r\nBased on this, a sample size of 240 AWCs per treatment arm allows us to detect an effect size of 0.15 standard deviations with 95% confidence at 80% power. Based on this sample size, the below table shows the level of power for different effect sizes.\r\n\r\nQuestion of Interest\tEffect size of 0.1 SD\tEffect size of 0.12 SD\tEffect size of 0.15 SD\r\nComparison of 1 treatment arm to 1 treatment arm (e.g. effect of 1 year of transfers in utero vs. after child is born)\t0.48\t0.63\t0.82\r\nComparison of 1 treatment arm to 2 treatment arms (e.g. effect of 1 year of transfers vs. 2 years of transfers)\t0.66\t0.82\t0.95",

In weak states, strengthening formal institutions can take decades, and so state and aid interventions also try to shape informal practices and norms governing disputes. Their goal is to improve bargaining and commitment, thus limiting disputes and violence. Mass education campaigns that promote alternative dispute resolution (ADR) are common examples of these interventions. We studied the short-term impacts of one such campaign in Liberia, where property disputes are endemic. Residents of 86 of 246 towns randomly received training in ADR practices and norms; this training reached 15% of adults. One year later, treated towns had higher resolution of land disputes and lower violence. Impacts spilled over to untrained residents. We also saw unintended consequences: more extrajudicial punishment and (weakly) more nonviolent disagreements. Results imply that mass education can change high-stakes behaviors, and improving informal bargaining and enforcement behavior can promote order in weak states.",

    "Experimental Design": "The government of Liberia nominated 246 communities in the counties of Lofa, Nimba and Grand Gedeh for ADR education. Out of these communities 116 were randomly chosen for treatment, the ADR education workshop, to be rolled out in five phases. Treatment communities were randomly assigned to the phases. Due to resource constraints, the training was completed in 86 communities instead of 116 leaving 160 as control.\rIn each treatment community, 15% of the adult population participated in the training which was conducted over 8 days by two facilitators over a period of two months. Groups of 35 participants were educated in each workshop. However, 16 of the 86 communities were subject to intense treatment whereby 25% of the population participated in the training to understand the marginal effect of increased training. The selection of these populations was not random rather were by choice of village leaders. \rEndline surveys begun approximately ten months after the first workshop and were conducted on a rolling basis even as treatment workshops were being rolled in many communities. Thus in some communities the endline survey was concurrent with treatment. Although this was unintentional, this allowed the researchers to understand the impact of the ADR education program over a timeline of zero months to almost two years.\r",

    "Abstract": "In the last five years, contract farming has become an increasingly common way for small producers in developing countries to ensure the supply of inputs, obtain new technologies, and gain access to markets. While these three elements are important to increasing productivity in developing country agricultural, little knowledge exists regarding 1) which element is most vital to the agent (farmer), 2) which is most vital to the principal, 3) and what are the relevant welfare impacts on both sides. In this project, we will work with a local NGO to develop and offer three different types of contracts designed to provide answers to these questions.\r Rice farming is relatively new to Benin and productivity there lags behind productivity levels in Asia. Government, policy analysts, NGOs, development agencies, and research institutes have invested heavily in rice production and all have proposed numerous reasons why output remains low. Three key potential reasons emerge from a review of this literature. First is that output markets are thin, making farmers uncertain of their ability to sell their harvest at a profitable price. This uncertainty limits investment in inputs and depresses productivity. Second is that, since rice cultivation is relatively new to Benin, farmers lack the skills and knowledge to cultivate rice in a highly productive way. Without skills training or technical backstopping, farmers remain below the global production possibilities frontier. Third is that farmers are credit constrained and unable to purchase improved inputs when they are needed. Working with a local NGO that is already engaged in contract rice farming, we have developed three types of contracts designed to uncovered what are the binding constraints to rice production in Benin.",

        "Abstract": "Contract farming has emerged as a popular mechanism to encourage vertical coordination in developing country agriculture. Yet, there is a lack of consensus on its ability to spur structural transformation in rural economies. We present results from a field experiment on contract farming for rice production in Benin. While all contracts have positive effects on welfare and productivity measures, we find that the simplest contract has impacts nearly as large as contracts with additional attributes. This suggests that once price risk is resolved through the offer of a fixed-price contract, farmers are able to address other constraints on their own.",

As a result, people's degree of happiness eventually returns to a stable reference level. We use a multi-country field experiment to examine the impact on subjective measures of well-being of the provision of improved housing to extremely poor populations in order to test whether they exhibit hedonic adaptation when their basic housing needs are met. After sixteen months, we find that subjective perceptions of well-being improve substantially for recipients of improved housing but that, after, on average, eight additional months, 60% of that gain has dissipated. Extrapolation achieved through estimation of a structural model of hedonic adaptation suggests that the decay rate of the treatment effect is 20% per month. As a\rresult, after 28 months of treatment exposure, we forecast that the entire treatment effect will have disappeared.",

    "Intervention(s)": "The program\r The TECHO program provides basic, pre-fabricated, transitional houses to extremely poor families living in informal settlements (slums) in Latin America regardless of whether or not they own the land on which they live. The aim of this program is to increase the well-being of these families. The program was started 19 years ago in Chile and now works in 19 Latin American countries. This NGO has built almost 100,000 houses with the help of an army of volunteers. Every year, more than 30,000 youths throughout Latin America volunteer to work with TECHO. We evaluate the program in three Latin American countries: El Salvador, Uruguay, and Mexico. \r TECHO targets the poorest informal settlements and, within these settlements, households that are lodged in very substandard dwellings. TECHO serves \"irregular settlements,\" which are de\ffined as communities in which a majority of the families are living on plots of land that they do not own. These settlements are plagued by a host of problems, including insufficient access to basic utilities (water, electricity and sanitation), signifi\fcant levels of soil and water contamination, and overcrowding. The typical housing units in these informal settlements are no better than the surrounding dwellings, as they are rudimentary units constructed from discarded materials such as cardboard, tin and plastic, have dirt floors and lack connections to basic utilities such as water supply and sewerage systems. \r The TECHO housing units are 18 square meters (6m by 3m) in size. The walls are made of pre-fabricated, insulated pinewood or aluminum panels, and the roofs are made of tin to keep occupants warm and protect them from humidity, insects, and rain. Floors are built on top of 15 stacks that raise them up to between 30 and 80 centimeters of the ground in order to reduce dampness and protect occupants from floods and infestations. Although these houses are a major improvement over the recipients' previous dwellings, the amenities that they offer are limited, as they do not include a bathroom or kitchen or plumbing, drinking water hook-ups or gas connections. The houses are designed to be low in cost and easy to construct; they can be placed on a plot of land next to an existing house or as a new unit\rthat replaces the existing one. Units are modular and portable, can be built with simple tools, and are set up by volunteers working in squads of from 4 to 8 members. The cost of a TECHO house is less than US$1,000 -- with the bulk of the cost being accounted for by the acquisition, storage and transportation of the building materials, since there are essentially no labor costs. The bene\fficiary family contributes 10% of that amount (around US$100). In El Salvador, US$100 is approximately equivalent to 3.3 months' per capita baseline earnings, while in Mexico and Uruguay, it is roughly equivalent to 1.6 and 1.4 months, respectively. Importantly, added to the fact that the TECHO house is heavily subsidized, there are no exact substitutes of TECHO houses on the market that households could be investing in incrementally. TECHO do not offer the house in the market and only offer it to a group of selected slum dwellers that are in the poorest conditions within slums. Hence, even if households did not face credit constrains to get access to housing improvements, they could not get access to TECHO houses neither in the form nor at the price offered by TECHO. This consideration is relevant for interpreting the results of our study. Finally, the houses are also easy to disassemble and move to a new location. It is important for the houses to be movable because most of the families in these makeshift settlements do not have formal title to the land that they live on. TECHO managers were concerned that upgrading the value of the land by building permanent housing might induce both public and private owners to try to force residents to move in order to reclaim the improved land. However, making the housing mobile does away with that incentive.",

Furthermore, we construct a summary index of subjective well-being. The summary index is computed as the sum of standardized satisfaction variables (with the sign of\reach measure oriented so that more beneficial outcomes have higher scores), divided by the number of satisfaction variables (4 in this case). This summary index aggregates information across related outcomes and is useful both as a summary statistic and possibly as a means of augmenting the statistical power to detect effects of the intervention that are consistent across groups of outcomes.",

    "Experimental Design": "Experimental design\r Between 2007 and 2010, TECHO implemented the program in a number of selected slums in each country. TECHO budget constraints limit the number of housing units that can be built at any one time. Under these constraints, TECHO opted to select beneficiaries by means of a lottery system that gives all eligible households within a settlement an equal opportunity to receive one of the units. TECHO first selected a set of eligible settlements and asked their volunteers to conduct a census to identify eligible households within each settlement, those with extremely poor housing conditions. The eligible households were then surveyed (baseline survey) and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups within each settlement. In general, the number of treatments represents a small portion of all the households in the settlement. For example, in around 40% of the settlements, less than 10% of the households were treated, and the proportion of treated households exceeded 50% of the slum population in only 8% of the settlements.\r In order to obtain accurate information from the households and to avoid creating any desirability bias in the treatment group, the data collection work was separated from the implementation of the intervention by contracting a highly respected survey firm in each country. The enumerators told the interviewees that they were collecting data for a study on living conditions\rand did not make any reference to TECHO verbally or in writing. After randomization, treatment households were told about the program and its requirements by TECHO offcials. Some of them agreed to participate in the program and some did not. Control households were explicitly not told that\rthey would receive the benefits provided by the program in the future, so their behavior should not have been affected by the expectation of being treated in the next round, although they may have felt frustrated when they realized that\rthey had lost the lottery. \r Since TECHO did not have the capacity to work in all settlements at the same time, the program was rolled out in each country in two phases at the settlement level. Baseline surveys were conducted approximately one month before the start of the construction work in each settlement, which gave\rhouseholds time to acquire the funds to make the 10% contribution required by the program, while the follow-up surveys were conducted simultaneously for\rall settlements for both phases in each country. \r While the settlements were not randomly allocated to phases, there is plausibly exogenous variation in the amount of time that beneficiaries had occupied the house at the time of the follow-up survey, since no discretionary criteria were used to select which slum went to which phase. Instead, the decision as to which slum would be treated first and which would be treated\rlater on depended on the inflow of census information about eligible households for each slum. When the information on the set of eligible households in each slum was delivered to the central office, TECHO organized its internal resources in such a way as to treat the assigned-to-treatment households in that slum as soon as possible. This suggests that the allocation of slums to phases depended more on the capacity of the volunteers assigned to each slum to conduct the census of eligible households than on the characteristics of the slum dwellers in that location. Phase I settlements had 24 months of exposure, on average, while Phase II settlements had an average of 16 months of exposure, for a difference of 8 months, on average. \r Our sample includes a total of 74 settlements, of which 29 were in Phase I and 45 were in Phase II. The total number of eligible households in these settlements was 2373. Treatment was offered to 57% of the households, and over 85% of those households actually received a new house. The remaining 15%\rthat were assigned to treatment could not afford the required 10% co-payment balanced across phases. Attrition rates between baseline and follow-up amounted to 6% of the\rhouseholds in the assigned-to-treatment group and 7% of those in the control group, with most of the attriters being households whose members moved out of the slum and could not be reached in their new location. This difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels. The difference between\rthe attrition rates of the assigned-to-treatment and control groups within each phase was not statistically significant either. Finally, the attrition rates are also balanced across phases.",

        "Abstract": "Subjective well-being may not improve in step with increases in material well-being due to hedonic adaptation, a psychological process that attenuates the long-term emotional impact of a favorable or unfavorable change in circumstances. As a result, people's degree of happiness eventually returns to a stable reference level. We use a multi-country field experiment to examine the impact on subjective measures of well-being of the provision of improved housing to extremely poor populations in order to test whether they exhibit hedonic adaptation when their basic housing needs are met. After sixteen months, we find that subjective perceptions of well-being improve substantially for recipients of improved housing but that, after, on average, eight additional months, 60% of that gain has dissipated. Extrapolation achieved through estimation of a structural model of hedonic adaptation suggests that the decay rate of the treatment effect is 20% per month. As a result, after 28 months of treatment exposure, we forecast that the entire treatment effect will have disappeared.",

By administering focused museum guided tours, we aim to highlight the potential positive impact of culture on societal attitudes, specifically in promoting the welcoming of immigrants. We propose a field experiment studying the impact of culture on perceptions of hospitality and immigration concerns. We will recruit students from the University of Siena and offer guided tours of the Santa Maria della Scala museum. Half of the visits will be standard museum tours, serving as control visits, while the other half will be specialized tours focused on the role of the pilgrimage to encourage reflections on hospitality and integration. The outcomes will be measured through post-visit surveys and participants' willingness to donate to an NGO supporting immigrants. Our research seeks to demonstrate that focused cultural exposure can enhance empathy and support for immigration, emphasizing the importance of culture in building a more inclusive society.",

We individuated a specific museum in Siena called Santa Maria della Scala. Such a museum has a particular history as it was a destination for pilgrims who were making a pilgrimage through the \"via Francigena\". Many of the pilgrims stayed in Siena even after their pilgrimage and contributed to the well-being of the Santa Maria hospital (and of the city). \r With the help of the museum guides, we designed two different tours of the former hospital. The first is the standard visit to the museum while the second will focus on the role of pilgrims. We believe that the treatment visit will present subjects with a positive example of integration that will make them re-evaluate our current situation. ",

Subjects will participate in a guided tour of Santa Maria della Scala museum in Siena. The tours will last approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Half of the tours will be control visits unrelated to themes of migration and hospitality: control subjects will visit the museum's isle dedicated to Fonte Gaia. The other half of the tour will focus on the frescoes in the Pilgrimage Hall of the museum. Such tours will focus on the previous role of the museum as a hospital helping people in need. This tour is designed to subtly highlight themes of hospitality and historical migration.\r The tour will be performed by employees of the museum who are professional guides. They prepared the itinerary of both visits and they have been instructed to be neutral in the exposition during the tours. It is key that the connection between the themes of the visit in the treated group and immigration arise naturally in the minds of the students, without nudging from the guide.\r After the visit, subjects will answer a final questionnaire. At the same time, we will ask subjects if they want to donate a fraction of the show-up fee. This is going to be the primary outcome we will measure to asses the impact of the treatment. Subsequently, subjects will complete part of the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 7 (i.e., B29 to B34). These self-reported measures will be used to investigate the effect of the treatment.",

    "Abstract": "We model farmers as facing small fixed costs of purchasing fertilizer and assume some are stochastically present biased and not fully sophisticated about this bias. Such farmers may procrastinate, postponing fertilizer purchases until later periods, when they may be too impatient to purchase fertilizer. Consistent with the model, many farmers in Western Kenya fail to take advantage of apparently profitable fertilizer investments, but they do invest in response to small, time-limited discounts on the cost of acquiring fertilizer (free delivery) just after harvest. Calibration suggests that this policy can yield higher welfare than either laissez-faire policies or heavy subsidies. ",

The farmer had to decide during the visit whether or not to participate in the program, and could buy any amount of fertilizer. In the second season, a new group of farmers was selected to receive the basic SAFI treatment. The second season also included additional interventions, structured as follows:\r SAFI with ex ante choice of timing: A field officer visited the farmers before the harvest and offered them the opportunity to decide when, during the next growing season, they wanted the officer to return to offer them the SAFI program. They were then visited at the specified time, and offered a chance to buy a voucher for future fertilizer use (as in the Basic SAFI program, as described above).\r Free delivery visit later in the season: Same as the basic SAFI intervention, but farmers were visited later in the season. A field officer visited farmers 2-4 months after the harvest (when it is time to apply fertilizer as a top-dressing to the next crop), and offered them the opportunity to buy fertilizer, at the regular price, with free delivery. \r Subsidy later in season: A field officer visited the farmers 2-4 months after the harvest (when it is time to apply fertilizer to the next crop) and offered to sell them fertilizer, at a 50 percent subsidy, with free delivery.\r In each of the intervention groups, as well as in the comparison group, a random subset of farmers was offered the option to sell a set quantity of maize at a favorable price to the field officer before the program took place.

    "Abstract": "The Millennium Challenge Corporation sponsored the Rwanda Threshold Program (RTP) to help the Government of Rwanda improve its performance on governance indicators related to citizens’ political rights and civil liberties. Mathematica Policy Research conducted an evaluation of the RTP’s Strengthening Civic Participation (SCP) component, an initiative with two focus areas: (1) supporting the efforts of civil society organizations to advocate for local issues and (2) training local government officials to increase responsiveness to the concerns and priorities of citizens. The evaluation uses a stratified random assignment design, whereby districts within each of Rwanda’s five provinces were paired based on district population and economic characteristics and then randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group. We designed a household survey to collect data for evaluating SCP impacts, and administered this survey at baseline before the program (in early 2011) and one year after the start of the program (2012). We drew nationally representative samples of approximately 10,000 households in each data collection round. The baseline and follow-up surveys collected data on respondents’ civic participation levels, including awareness and perceptions of local government performance, responsiveness, and accountability. Specifically, respondents were asked about their awareness of local government meetings, familiarity with local government officials, perceived citizen influence, and knowledge and access to information about local government affairs. Respondents were also asked about their overall satisfaction with government services related to water infrastructure, local road conditions, waste collection, public schools, and health clinics. We use this household survey data to analyze program impacts.",

    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "We estimated the impacts of the Strengthening Civic Participation program for six outcome indices: awareness of local government meetings, familiarity with local government officials, knowledge about local government affairs, access to district government information, citizen influence on government, and satisfaction with local services. We constructed these outcome indices by grouping together survey questions related to the same underlying outcome using factor analysis. We did this for several reasons. First, estimating the impacts by comparing the treatment and the control groups on several survey questions is likely to result in one or more statistically significant impacts by chance when there is actually no impact. In other words, we are more likely to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, when considering a series of hypothesis tests—a problem commonly known as the multiple comparison problem (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Second, since factor analysis assumes that the observed variables are influenced by a few underlying variables or factors that are unobserved, constructing those underlying latent variables (the unobserved factors) can provide useful information about processes or behavior of the population of interest. Third, grouping survey questions into a few outcome indices helps in examining impacts in a tractable manner.\r For each of the six outcome domains, we conducted factor analysis using the survey questions or observed variables that are most relevant for that domain in three steps: \r (1) We used the principal-component factor method to obtain the factor solutions. For each outcome domain, we found that only one underlying factor explained the variation in the responses to the included survey questions. \r (2) We then used orthogonal rotation to rotate the factor loadings and estimated factor scores using the regression method, which estimates a factor as a weighted sum of the included observed variables. \r (3) Finally, we converted each of the six estimated factors to binary variables to interpret the impact estimates better. In particular, if a survey respondent’s factor score was above the mean score for the full survey sample in that year, the binary variable was coded as 1, otherwise it was coded as 0.  Thus, the impact estimates compare the percentage of citizens with an above-average factor score in the treatment districts with the percentage in control districts. ",

    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "",
    "Experimental Design": "The activities under the Strengthening Civic Participation component of the RTP were planned to be implemented in two separate, year-long phases, with 15 districts receiving activities in each phase. We took advantage of this plan by randomly dividing Rwanda’s 30 districts to either phase I or phase II. To do so, districts within each province were first matched in pairs or groups of three to ensure the best possible match between the two district groups.  The districts were matched on the following five district characteristics:\r •\tPopulation change between 2002 and 2006\r•\tPopulation density\r•\tCommon Development Fund (CDF) appropriation amounts for FY 2008 (as a proxy for poverty levels)\r•\tShare of district spending obtained through local revenues in FY 2008\r•\tDistrict expenditure per capita on good governance and social affairs \r These matched district pairs or triplets were then used as randomization blocks. Specifically, after these blocks were created a public lottery was conducted in the presence of district officials to randomly assign districts within each block to the treatment group (districts that would receive program activities in phase I in 2011), or the control group (districts that were to receive program activities in phase II in 2012). The 15 control districts never received any program activities because the RTP was not extended beyond 2011.\r",

Regular screening is a key measure to manage CVD risk, but the uptake of such services remains low. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Indonesia to assess whether personalized and targeted text messages increase the usage of public screening services for diabetes and hypertension in the at-risk population. Our intervention increased screening uptake by 6.6 percentage points. We show that text messages can be effective in the context of a relatively new disease burden in LMICs, where population responses may still be shaped by low salience and missing screening routines.",

    "Abstract": "A national football federation sends an email to coaches of amateur football clubs, pointing to the important role football plays in promoting inclusivity and reducing racism in society. The email also describes findings from earlier studies showing that discrimination is present in amateur football. Each amateur football club in the country is randomly assigned to either receiving the email or not. At most one coach per club is contacted. In the next stage of the experiment, fictitious applications will be sent to coaches asking if it is possible to join a training session. The applications, which are send by email, will differ only in the contact name (foreign- or native-sounding names). We study whether coaches who were sent the email from the national football federation respond differently to the email requests to join a training session as compared to coaches who were not sent the email from the national football federation. Our main prediction is that the email from the federation leads to an increase in positive responses to email requests to join a training session signed with a foreign name, whereas we expect no effects for email requests to join a training session signed with a native name. A positive response is defined as either an invitation to come to a training or a conditional acceptance (e.g. yes, you're welcome, but only if you are a player of a particular type, e.g. defender).

    "Intervention (Hidden)": "The email is in Norwegian. A translation of the email is:\r Subject: Football for all - for inclusion and against racism \r Dear coach, \r Football is the world's most popular sport and it gives us responsibility and the opportunity to unite people from different  backgrounds. It is important for all of us that football is multicultural and diverse and reflects our entire society - not just for professionals, but for all players. At the amateur level, football facilitates integration and promotes interaction on and off the field. We aim to make football easily accessible to all members of our society. \r Racism and exclusion are a societal problem and, thus, also a problem of football. \r Scientific studies showed that it is more difficult for people with foreign names to join an amateur football club. Regardless of sport or language skills, players with foreign names are less likely to get a response when contacting a club for the first time. \r This barrier to participating in sports is not only negative for foreigners, but also for Norwegians with a migration background and the Norwegian society. Creating diverse teams with members from different backgrounds is the key to improving social inclusion. \r We have sent this email to all coaches in Norway to applause you on the work you do and encourage everyone to continue to help keep the door to football open to all interested.\r 2021 will be a strange year, but we hope that at least autumn will be almost normal for most people and that together we can look forward to a glorious 2022.\r This email was signed by a person of the federation.

        "Abstract": "A rich literature shows that ethnic discrimination is an omnipresent and highly persistent phenomenon. Little is known, however, about how to reduce discrimination. This study reports the results of a large-scale field experiment we ran together with the Norwegian Football Federation. The federation sent an email to a random selection of about 500 amateur soccer coaches, pointing towards the important role that soccer can play in promoting inclusivity and reducing racism in society and calling on the coaches to be open to all interested applicants. Two weeks later, we sent fictitious applications to join an amateur club, using either a native-sounding or a foreign-sounding name, to the same coaches and to a random selection of about 500 coaches who form the control group. In line with earlier research, we find that applications from people with a native-sounding name receive significantly more positive responses than applications from people with a foreign-sounding name. Surprisingly and unintentionally, the email from the federation substantially increased rather than decreased this gap. Our study underlines the importance of running field experiments to check whether well-intended initiatives are effective in reducing discrimination.",

Using an experiment in Zambia that varied whether women were given access to contraceptives alone or with their husbands, we find that women given access with their husbands were 19 percent less likely to seek family planning services, 25 percent less likely to use concealable contraception, and 27 percent more likely to give birth. However, women given access to contraception alone report a lower subjective well-being, suggesting a psychosocial cost of making contraceptives more concealable.",

To ensure that vouchers were not used by individuals outside of the sample, the wife’s name and NRC numbers were written on the voucher by enumerators during the house visit, and women were instructed to bring their NRC cards to the clinic at the time of the visit for the nurse to verify. \r Fertility: birth rates 9–13 months after a respondent received a voucher.\r Well-being: measured by effect on separation, domestic violence, condom use, and self-reported well-being metrics: life satisfaction, happiness and peace of mind. Satisfaction is measured using the following question: All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days? Please tell me which number on this scale more adequately represents your level of satisfaction with your life as a whole: one means you are “completely dissatisfied” and five means you are “completely satisfied.” Health is measured using the following question: Compared to women in your community of the same age, how would you describe your overall health? Happiness is measured using the following question: Compared to women in your community of the same age, how would you describe your overall level of happiness and peace of mind? “very unhappy or discontent” is coded as one and “very happy and content” is coded as five.

Although the voucher intervention only required the husband’s presence in the Couple condition, criteria (vi) was imposed on all subjects in order to prevent higher rates of attrition among those assigned to the Couple condition relative to those in the Individual condition. \r The experiment consisted of a baseline survey in the first visit administered solely to the wife, during which an appointment was made for a second visit with both the wife and husband. Individual versus Couple condition was then randomly assigned. During the second visit, husband and wife were surveyed separately. In the Individual condition, the wife was given the voucher in private and in the Couple condition, the voucher was given to the husband in presence of the wife.\r Two years later, researchers conducted a follow-up survey to study the impact of contraceptive access on fertility( birth rates 9–13 months after a respondent received the voucher) and well-being.",

        "Abstract": "HOUSEHOLD BARGAINING AND EXCESS FERTILITY: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IN ZAMBIA\r We posit that household decision-making over fertility is characterized by moral hazard since most contraception can only be perfectly observed by the woman. Using an experiment in Zambia that varied whether women were given access to contraceptives alone or with their husbands, we find that women given access with their husbands were 19 percent less likely to seek family planning services, 25 percent less likely to use concealable contraception, and 27 percent more likely to give birth. However, women given access to contraception alone report a lower subjective well-being, suggesting a psychosocial cost of making contraceptives more concealable.",

Firms were randomly allocated into treatment and control groups, and the intervention was done at the plant level within each firm. Both treatment and control plants were given recommendations for improving management practices in several areas, and the treatment plants received additional consulting assistance in implementing the recommendations. The intervention led to a substantial adoption of the recommended practices in the treatment plants and a modest one in the control plants, with corresponding improvements in various measures of performance.

    "Experimental Design": "Our original experiment measured the impact of improving management practices in a set of large textile firms near Mumbai. This experiment involved 28 plants across 17 firms in the woven cotton fabric industry. Firms had been in operation for 20 years on average, and all were family-owned and managed. These firms are large, complex organizations, with a median of 2 plants per firm and 4 reporting levels (Table A1 reports baseline summary statistics). We contracted with a leading international management consultancy firm to work with the plants in order to change plant-level management practices rapidly. \rThe intervention ran from August 2008 until August 2010, with data collection continuing until November 2011. The intervention focused on a set of 38 management practices that are standard in American, European, and Japanese manufacturing firms and which can be grouped into five broad areas:  factory operations, quality control, inventory control, human-resources management, and sales and orders management (for details see Appendix Table A2). Each practice was measured as a binary indicator of the adoption (1) or non-adoption (0) of the practice. \rThe consulting intervention had three phases. The diagnostic phase took one month and was given to all treatment and control experimental plants. It involved evaluating the current management practices of each plant, constructing a performance database, and providing each plant with a detailed analysis of its current management practices along with recommendations for change. The second phase was a four-month implementation phase given only to the treatment experimental plants. In this phase, the consulting firm followed up on the diagnostic report to help introduce as many of the 38 management practices as the plants could be persuaded to adopt. The third phase was a measurement phase, which lasted until November 2011, involving the collection of performance and management data from all treatment and control plants. \rSee Bloom et al.

        "Abstract": "A long-standing question is whether differences in management practices\racross firms can explain differences in productivity, especially in developing\rcountries where these spreads appear particularly large. To investigate this,\rwe ran a management field experiment on large Indian textile firms. We provided\rfree consulting on management practices to randomly chosen treatment\rplants and compared their performance to a set of control plants. We find that\radopting these management practices raised productivity by 17% in the first\ryear through improved quality and efficiency and reduced inventory, and\rwithin three years led to the opening of more production plants.

    "Abstract": "In India alone, it is estimated that 3.5 million people suffer from Tuberculosis. The under-detection of TB represents a key challenge for health officials in developing countries because the success of any treatment program rests crucially on identifying those who have the disease. We propose to evaluate an approach with the potential to augment and strengthen the WHO’s global strategy for community engagement in the fight against TB. We will explore the use of financial incentives to encourage referrals, and we will focus on a specific community group with unique potential to generate referrals; current patients under treatment for TB. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of different types of financial incentives to encourage TB patients to refer people from within their social networks for TB screening and testing. We will vary the conditionality of the incentives (“unconditional” and “conditional” incentives), the method of outreach (\"peer-to-peer outreach\" or \"provider promotional visits\") and whether the new suspects know who named them (“known referrer” and “anonymous referrer” conditions). \r",

    "Intervention(s)": "In collaboration with Operation ASHA (OpASHA), an Indian NGO that operates 200 community-based DOTS (“Directly Observed Treatment Short Course”) centers in India, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of different types of financial incentives to encourage referrals from current TB patients to new suspects. We will vary (1) the conditionality of the incentives (“unconditional” and “conditional” incentives), (2) whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers (“patient outreach” and “patient provides names” conditions), and (3) whether the new suspects know who named them (“known referrer” and “anonymous referrer” conditions). \r The “unconditional” incentive will consist of Rupees (Rs.) 150 offered to current patients for each new suspect they induce to come to the center and get tested for TB. When the reward is fixed, each current patient has an incentive to refer any person who may be willing to be tested, irrespective of whether they know or believe they have TB. The “conditional” incentive treatment will consist of Rs. 100 for each new suspect who comes to the center and gets tested, plus a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB. Comparison of the effect of conditional and unconditional incentives will allow us to determine whether the subjects take advantage of incentives that do not depend on test results, and whether they have concrete information about their contacts’ health. \r To separate the effect of current patients’ networks from their ability to deliver information and persuade new suspects to get tested, we will vary whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers. In the “patient outreach” treatment, current patients will be given a set of referral cards and will be told that they will receive the reward if new suspects present at the center with the card and get tested for TB; in the “patient provides names” treatment, current patients will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they believe should get tested, and will receive the reward if the new suspect, who will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, comes to the center and gets tested. \r Finally, there will be two versions of the “patient provides names” treatment. In the “known referrer” version, the health workers will reveal to the new suspects who named them, whereas in the “anonymous referrer” version, the name of the referrer will not be revealed to the new suspects. This will allow us to determine the extent to which social stigma is a barrier to referrals. In fact, if social costs are the reason why current patients are reluctant to approach others, anonymity should remove them resulting in more and perhaps more effective referrals.\r ",

    "Experimental Design Details": "Below we explain how our experimental design will allow us to answer our primary research questions. This will also clarify the marginal contribution of each treatment arm.\r The experimental variation will allow us to test for the effectiveness of a variety of incentives, in order to identify the mechanisms through which barriers to referrals and treatment are alleviated. To measure the effects of our interventions, we will estimate versions (e.g., probit) of the following econometric model:\r yij= α + βE ecnourage +  βR reward +  βB bonus + βN names +βA anonym + γXi +Tt + εijt \r where i denotes the individual patients, j the randomly assigned treatment condition, and t the month of the intervention. yij represents the outcome variable of interest (e.g., yi = 1 if patient i made a referral, and 0 otherwise; or yi = 1 if patient i referred someone who tested positive for TB, and 0 otherwise). The key parameters of interest on the right-hand side of model (1) are the treatment effects βk, with the constant α representing, all else equal, the response in the pure control condition T0. First of all, the estimated coefficient βE will reveal whether encouragement to refer new suspects has an effect, even in the absence of incentives. In fact, an explicit appeal accompanied by referral cards might increase the salience of the request, thereby increasing referrals. Second, comparing βR and βE will determine whether financial rewards are effective at inducing current patients to find and refer new suspects (Q1). Third, comparing βB vs. βR will allow us to assess the extent to which unconditional incentives induce strategic behavior on the part of patients to refer individuals who are not sick only to obtain the reward (Q2a) and whether the current patients have concrete information on the health status of their social contacts (Q2b). Specifically, if patients in the unconditional incentive arm behave opportunistically by disproportionally referring people who are not sick, the number of referrals made will be higher and the share that test positive for TB smaller compared to those for patients in the bonus condition. Such a result will also indicate that patients do have information about the health condition of their social contacts (or an obtain it by exerting more effort). Fourth, comparison between βN and βE will reveal whether outreach by peers (current patients) or outreach by health workers is more effective in enrolling new suspects (Q3). Since current patients may also contact new suspects when they receive incentives based on intake of those new suspects, we can also estimate differences-in-differences specifications that include the interaction between eligibility for a reward, and outreach by peers vs. health workers. Finally, the estimated coefficient βA will inform us about the role of stigma and other “social costs” in making current patients reluctant to make referrals (Q4). For example, if we found that the share of referrals who are TB positive is higher when the referrer remains anonymous, that would indicate that stigma and related social costs are indeed a barrier that is making patients reluctant to approach others in their social circles who are likely also sick. Tt are month fixed effects, included to control for seasonality effects and other unobservable factors associated with the different intervention periods. Individual characteristics (including demographics such as age and gender, and other characteristics such as personality traits, experience with the disease and the clinic, etc.) will be reported in the vector of controls Xi. εijt is the error term. Because the randomization was done at the center level, we adjust the standard errors by allowing for clustering by center.\r",

Each cycle will include anywhere between 18 and 40 centers, based on the spread of centers across geographic areas. For each cycle, the project randomizes the outreach type and the incentives at the center- level, with stratification based on geographic location.  The centers will then be randomized into one of nine treatment arms and a control arm before the start of a data collection cycle.

We focus on three key outcomes of interest: Y1 = 1 if the patient made at least one referral, 0 otherwise; Y2 = N. of referrals made by the patient; Y3 = Number of TB positive referrals made by the patient.  \r\n\r\nGiven the standard deviation of the outcome variables, the effects found in a pilot study imply the following effect sizes (effect/standard deviation): 0.45 for Y1, 0.58 for Y2, and 0.59 for Y3. \r\n\r\nThe intra-class correlations within centers from the pilot are as follows: Y1 ICC = 0.07; Y2 ICC = 0.13; Y3 ICC = 0.14. \r\nThe minimum detectable effect sizes are 0.31 for Y1, 0.38 for Y2, and 0.39 for Y3 assuming 0.80 power; and 0.36 for Y1, 0.44 for Y2, and 0.45 for Y3 assuming 0.90 power. \r\n\r\nGiven that the effects we obtained in the pilot are substantially larger than those computed in these power calculations, we conclude that our proposed sample sizes of 20 sites for T0-T9 are appropriate to detect effects of meaningful size.  Note that in the pilot, the incentives conditional on TB test results delivered effects similar in magnitude to those of the encouragement condition. In the full-scale experiment, we have increased the expected value of the conditional reward to match that of the unconditional one, which we anticipate will increase its size effect. \r\n",

        "Abstract": "We study whether and how peer referrals increase screening, testing, and identification of patients with tuberculosis, an infectious disease responsible for over one million deaths annually. In an experiment with 3,176 patients at 122 tuberculosis treatment centers in India, we find that small financial incentives raise the probability that existing patients refer prospective patients for screening and testing, resulting in cost-effective identification of new cases. Incentivized referrals operate through two mechanisms: peers have private information about individuals in their social networks to target for outreach, and they are more effective than health workers in inducing these individuals to get tested.",

    "Abstract": "Strong future-time reference (=strong-FTR) languages (e.g. English) require a dedicated marking of the future (e.g. in English with “will” or “going to”), while weak future-time reference (=weak-FTR) languages (e.g. German) do not require to mark the future. Previous research suggests that strong-FTR languages make the future feel more distant than the present, implying that more short-term-oriented behavior occurs in areas such as saving and health. The aim of this research project is to examine the causal effect of the linguistic structure on individual pro-environmental behavior (PEB) within a weak-FTR language (German). More specifically, we will take advantage of the German language in which speakers can freely choose whether or not to use the future tense when talking about future events. In a between-subject online experiment, we will manipulate the use of future time referencing (weak-FTR vs. strong-FTR, respectively present tense vs. future tense marking) in order to examine its effect on pro-environmental behavior. We will elicit subjects’ pro-environmental behavior using a new incentivized decision task in which individuals can decide whether to invest money to plant trees or keep it for themselves. ",

    "Abstract": "Researchers evaluate the effects of academic achievement awards for first and second-year college students on a Canadian commuter campus. The award scheme offered linear cash incentives for course grades above 70. Awards were paid every term. Program participants also had access to peer advising by upperclassmen. Program engagement appears to have been high but overall treatment effects were small. The intervention increased the number of courses graded above 70 and points earned above 70 for second-year students, but there was no significant effect on overall GPA. Results are somewhat stronger for a subsample that correctly described the program rules. Researchers argue that these results fit in with an emerging picture of mostly modest effects for cash award programs of this type at the post-secondary level.",

    "Intervention(s)": "Researchers used a randomized evaluation to measure the impact of the OK program’s financial awards and academic support services on student achievement. All eligible students were invited to apply to the program by completing an intake survey. Of the 1,271 eligible students who completed the survey, 400 first and second year students were randomly selected to participate—100 male and 100 female students in each year. The remaining students, who completed the survey but were not invited to participate in the OK program, served as a control group.\r OK program participants earned $100 for each class in which they attained a grade of 70 percent or better, and an additional $20 for each percentage point above 70 percent. Rewards were paid out at the end of every term. In addition, these students were randomly assigned and contacted by peer advisors—paid and trained upper-class students who provided advice about study strategies, time management, and university bureaucracy as well as information about OK scholarships. Advisors emailed advisees once every two to three weeks, whether or not the advisees responded. Program engagement was high; by year’s end, at least 86 percent of OK participants had checked their scholarship earnings on the OK website or emailed a peer advisor or program staff.\r Data for this study came primarily from university records containing information on applicants, enrolled students, and course grades.

    "Experimental Design": "The “Opportunity Knocks” (OK) experiment was implemented on an Ontario commuter campus affiliated with a large public university in the fall of 2008. First and second-year students who applied for financial aid were offered the chance to participate in the program. Those who agreed were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Treated students earned $100 for each class in which they attained a grade of 70 or better and an additional $20 for each percentage point above 70 percent. Researchers focused on grades near 70 because anything worse is typically seen as unsatisfactory and because awards for lower levels of achievement are likely to be prohibitively expensive. A student with a full-course load scoring 75 in every course qualified for $2,000 over the course of the school year (10 * ($100 + (5 * 20))). Randomly assigned peer advisors, upper-class students who had been trained to provide advice about study strategies, time management, and university bureaucracy, also contacted participants. \r In late summer of 2008, researchers invited 1,056 first years and 1,073 second years to participate in OK. Eligible students are those who had requested financial aid, had an email address, had a high school GPA recorded in the university administrative information system, and had enrolled for at least 1.5 credits (half of a full load) in the fall semester. Invitees who completed the intake survey and gave consent were eligible for random assignment. Of the 1,271 students who completed the survey and were eligible, 400 were treated. Treatment assignment was stratified by year (first and second) and sex, with 100 in each group. Within sex-year cells, assignment was stratified by high school GPA quartile, with 25 in each group (the analysis controls for strata). \r In an effort to gauge subjects’ understanding of program award rules, researchers included in the OK intake survey two questions meant to gauge subjects’ understanding of program award rules. The first asked students to calculate the award amount for one class, and the second asked them to calculate the total award amount from five classes. Approximately two-thirds of the sample evaluated the example correctly. The services component of OK matched all treated students with (trained and paid) same-sex peer advisors. Peer advisors were enthusiastic upper-year students or recent graduates with good grades. Each peer advisor covered 50 participants. Advisors emailed advisees once every two to three weeks, offering advice on upcoming academic events and workshops and guidance relevant for key periods in the academic calendar, such as midterms and finals. Advisors also provided information about OK scholarships, including reminders of the scholarship calculation and payment schedules. Advisors invited their clients to turn to them for help with any academic or personal issues that seemed relevant to academic success.\r The data for this study come primarily from the university records containing information on applicants, enrolled students, and course grades. Researchers supplemented this with data from a baseline survey used to identify the population eligible for random assignment, as well as more descriptive focus-group style information collected from a few subjects after the experiment. \r Analysis compares the amount earned by the experimental group with the earnings that students in the control group would have been entitled to had they been in the program. A large program effect should be reflected in larger-than expected earnings, where expected earnings are measured using the grade distribution in the control sample. Estimates of earnings and other effects come from regressions, where the dependent variable is the outcome for a given student in a given stratum, controlling for strata effects, treatment assignment indicator, and additional controls (e.g., age, high school grade average, whether 1st language is English, mother is a college graduate, and father is a college graduate, correctly answered harder question on scholarship formula, controls who would have earned some scholarship money, hypothetical earnings for controls). Because treatment is randomly assigned, covariates are unnecessary to reduce omitted variables bias in the estimated treatment effects. Models with covariates may, however, generate more precise estimates.\r In addition to assessment of intention-to-treat effects, researchers also used two stage least squares (2SLS) to estimate the effect of treatment on participants. Some of those assigned to treatment did not really participate in the program. Researchers used the randomly assigned offer of OK treatment as an instrument for program take-up (any contact); by virtue of random assignment the OK offer is unrelated to characteristics of eligible students. Because no one in the control group participated, 2SLS estimates capture the effect of participation on program participants (Number of Courses with Grade of At Least 70 Percent, Total Grade Percentage Points Over 70 Percent, GPA, Average Grades, (Hypothetical) Program Earnings). Effects on program participants give a kind of theoretical upper bound on program effects for this particular intervention; these estimates tell us how much achievement was boosted for those who responded to incentives in some measurable way.\r Researchers look at treatment effects for the entire sample and for those who answered the second assessment question correctly to see if the effects of the OK scholarships depend on participants’ understanding of how the formula linking grades and awards works.\r To assess students’ perception of the experiment-induced motivation, the OK sign-up survey asked students to predict their average grades in two scenarios: as an OK participant and as a non-participant. To encourage a thoughtful response, researchers offered to win a $500 prize to be given to the student whose predictions came closest to the mark. After the program ended, researchers asked students who predicted no effect in the intake survey why they had expected this. This generated very low response rate. Researchers also surveyed a random sample of 50 students from the treatment group at the end of the school year (May 13, 2009), offering $25 movie gift certificates to those who responded to tell whether and how the scholarship motivated them. Researchers also assessed self-reported usefulness of peer advisor e-mails.",

    "Intervention(s)": "For the multi-faceted program in Ghana, Graduating from Ultra Poverty (\"GUP\"), implementers first identified poor communities in poor regions of the country. In each identified community, staff members then facilitated a Participatory Wealth Ranking (PWR), in which members of the community worked together to rank households by economic status. Finally, staff members returned for a verification of the households judged to be the poorest. The program was implemented by Presbyterian Agricultural Services, a local nongovernmental organization, in coordination with Innovations for Poverty Action, a non-profit research organization. \r The basic GUP program involved the transfer of a productive asset; skills training for the management of the asset as well as life skills training, a weekly cash stipend for consumption support, worth between $6 and $9 PPP depending on family size, lasting for 3-10 months; access to a savings account at a local bank (details below in the experimental design section, as this is one of the components unpacked); and some basic health services and health education. The productive asset was provided at the beginning of the program, and households were permitted to choose a package of assets from a set list. The rest of these services were delivered over two years via regular visits (typically weekly) by a field officer from the implementing organization.",

    "Primary Outcomes (end points)": "asset value index, consumption index, financial inclusion index, food security index, income index",
    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "For each variables within a given index, we take the control mean and standard deviation and and compute the z-score. Then we average all the z-scores in the index, and again take the control mean and standard deviation to compute our final indexed outcome. Our asset value index contains just one variable: the total asset value, where each asset is priced in goats using price data from other countries where we have price data (under the assumption that relative prices are constant across countries).  Our consumption index is total consumption. Our financial inclusion index includes total savings balances and total loans received in the last year. Our food security index includes three variables. The first two variables equal 0 if the household answered \"all year\" or \"during the lean season only\" to the following questions, about adults and kids, respectively: \"Did adults/kids ever reduce number of meals per day or reduce portions over the past year?\" The third variable equals 0 if the household answered \"all year\" or \"during the lean season only\" to the question \"Did adults ever skip entire days without eating?\" Our income index includes monthly business income, monthly crop income, monthly wage income, and monthly animal revenue. ",
    "Secondary Outcomes (end points)": "business income, crop income, animal revenue, wage income, savings deposits, livestock value (goat, fowl, pig, sheep, cow)",
    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "Savings deposits come directly from administrative data collected at the individual-week level. To compute livestock value, we take the median buy price and the median sell price across villages, and then take the average of the two. We then multiple this price by the number of livestock owned.",
    "Experimental Design": "The program included several experimental arms designed to unpack whether specific components were sufficient on their own. First, we introduced variation in the core program at the household level: 50% of sample households within GUP villages were randomly assigned to the graduation program without savings (\"GUP without savings\"), and 50% received the standard program with collection of\rsavings for deposit into a local bank by the field agent (\"GUP with savings\").\r Second, we introduced two additional treatment groups at the village-level. For each of these two additional treatment groups, a two-level design was maintained, thus creating treatment households in treatment villages, control households in treatment villages, and control households in control villages. \r In Asset-Only villages, 50% of sample households were assigned to treatment, and received only a productive asset, without skills training on how to use it, or any of the other GUP components. These households were simply given four goats, since this was the most popular asset in GUP (71% of households chose a package of assets that included four goats). Goats were chosen because most households have had or have some goats, and thus would typically be content with receiving more, and we did not want to interact with the households and give them choices for fear that such engagement itself could change behavior.\r In Saving Out of Ultra Poverty (\"SOUP\") villages, 59% of sample households were assigned to the SOUP treatment, and received a visit from the field agent to collect savings, just as in the GUP with savings group, but did not receive any other components of the program. Of this 59%, half received savings accounts and deposit collection without a match (“SOUP without match”) and half received savings accounts and deposit collection with a 50% match (\"SOUP with match\"). Specifically, for every GHC 1 deposited, households in this group received a matching contribution of GHC 0.50. The remaining households in SOUP villages were assigned to the SOUP control group.",

Differences in callbacks by sex and marital status were not statistically significant. Women and especially married women were, however, particularly likely to be asked for more information rather than scheduled for an interview.

Then, in treatment groups only, fingerprints were collected as part of the loan application and an explanation was given that this would be used to determine their identity on any future loan applications.

By not producing paprika (or producing less), the borrower is better able to avoid repayment. Therefore, land allocation to paprika can be a measure of the degree of moral hazard.\r5)\tInputs used on paprika: Likewise, non-application of inputs on the paprika crop facilitates default on the loan and is therefore another form of moral hazard since only paprika output can feasibly be seized by the lender.\r6)\tFarm profits: market crop sales, the value of unsold crops, and profits.",

Random assignment determined whether contact was initiated\rby a gay or straight canvasser and whether the canvasser discussed the subject of same-sex\rmarriage or recycling. Outcomes were assessed unobtrusively by online surveys conducted days,\rweeks, and months afterward.  Canvassers were coached to be polite and respectful at all times, to listen attentively\rto voters when discussing either same-sex marriage or recycling, and to refrain from arguing with\rvoters. The\rsame-sex marriage script invited voters to share their experiences with marriage. This script was the\rsame for gay and straight canvassers, with one important exception. After establishing rapport with\rthe voter, midway through the conversation, gay canvassers revealed that they are gay or lesbian and\rthat they would like to get married but that the law prohibits same-sex marriage. Straight canvassers\rinstead described how their child, friend, or relative would like to get married but that the law prohibits\rsame-sex marriage. Voters were asked to share their thoughts on this dilemma. These doorstep\rconversations lasted on average 22 minutes.",

    "Primary Outcomes (end points)": "Before canvassers went into the field, the study first gathered baseline\rpositions on a range of political attitudes for all participants using an ostensibly unrelated online\rsurvey. The survey included 50 questions, as described in the Supplemental Online Materials (SOM).\rThe two questions concerning same-sex marriage and feelings about gay people were buried amid\ra large number of items on unrelated topics so that respondents would not suspect any connection\rbetween the survey and the canvassing visit. The panel survey included the two outcome measures in\revery wave, but the overall content of the survey was kept fresh by randomly rotating new questions\rin each wave. Another important feature of the design concerns blinding of canvassers and survey\rrespondents. Voters were unaware that the online survey was related to the canvassing effort, and\rcanvassers had no knowledge that voters were participants in an online survey. Finally, to prevent\rhousemates from completing each other’s surveys, extensive precautions were taken, including issuing distinct personal login instructions to take differently named surveys, tracking of distinct IP addresses\rand session cookies, and sending invitations to take the survey during working hours (91% were in\rfact completed at work), when housemates would be less likely to be together.",
    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "Survey Outcome Measures: \r1. Support For Same-Sex Marriage: Wording and format followed the Cooperative Campaign\rAnalysis Project 2012 (Jackman et al 2012): “Do you favor or oppose allowing gays and lesbians\rto marry legally?” Response options ranged from strongly oppose to strongly favor, forming\ra five-point scale.\r2. Ratings of Gays and Lesbians: Wording and format followed the Cooperative Campaign\rAnalysis Project 2012 (Jackman et al 2012): “We would like to get your feelings toward a\rseries of demographic groups. We will display the name of a group, and we would like you\rto rate the group using a ‘feeling thermometer.’ Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees\rindicate that you feel favorable and warm toward the group. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50\rdegrees mean that you don’t feel favorable toward the group and that you don’t care too much\rfor that group. You would rate the group at the 50 degree mark if you don’t feel particularly\rwarm or cold toward the group. Your rating will appear at the end of the slider.”",

    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "",
    "Experimental Design": "Registered voters who had previously been enrolled in an Internet panel survey were\rcontacted at their doorstep by canvassers. Random assignment determined whether contact was initiated\rby a gay or straight canvasser and whether the canvasser discussed the subject of same-sex\rmarriage or recycling. Outcomes were assessed unobtrusively by online surveys conducted days,\rweeks, and months afterward.",
    "Experimental Design Details": "",
    "Randomization Method": "Households in which at least two registered voters completed the first\rwave of the on-line panel survey (May 29-30, 2013) were randomly assigned to five experimental\rconditions. Simple random assignment occurred at the household level to facilitate the analysis of\rwithin-household spillovers discussed below. The first group was assigned to receive the same-sex\rmarriage script from a gay canvasser. The second group was assigned to receive the same-sex marriage\rscript from a straight canvasser. Groups three and four were encouraged to recycle household waste\rby gay or straight canvassers, respectively; however, canvassers did not reveal their sexual orientation\rwhen delivering the recycling script. The fifth group was a control group to which no canvassers were\rassigned.",

        "Abstract": "Can a single conversation change minds on divisive social issues, such as same-sex marriage? A randomized placebo-controlled trial assessed whether gay (n = 22) or straight (n = 19) messengers were effective at encouraging voters (n = 972) to support same-sex marriage and whether attitude change persisted and spread to others in voters’ social networks. The results, measured by an unrelated panel survey, show that both gay and straight canvassers produced large effects initially, but only gay canvassers’ effects persisted in 3-week, 6-week, and 9-month follow-ups. We also find strong evidence of within-household transmission of opinion change, but only in the wake of conversations with gay canvassers. Contact with gay canvassers further caused substantial change in the ratings of gay men and lesbians more generally. These large, persistent, and contagious effects were confirmed by a follow-up experiment. Contact with minorities coupled with discussion of issues pertinent to them is capable of producing a cascade of opinion change.",
