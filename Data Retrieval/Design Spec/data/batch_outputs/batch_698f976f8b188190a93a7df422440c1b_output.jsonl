Second-stage randomization is a phased rollout of parent sensitization among treatment schools (term 1 vs term 2 of 2011).\"}"}], "role": "assistant"}], "parallel_tool_calls": true, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "previous_response_id": null, "prompt_cache_key": null, "prompt_cache_retention": null, "reasoning": {"effort": "none", "summary": null}, "safety_identifier": null, "service_tier": "default", "store": true, "temperature": 1.0, "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "description": null, "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}, "verbosity": "medium"}, "tool_choice": "auto", "tools": [], "top_logprobs": 0, "top_p": 0.98, "truncation": "disabled", "usage": {"input_tokens": 1338, "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "output_tokens": 1193, "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}, "total_tokens": 2531}, "user": null, "metadata": {}}}, "error": null}
