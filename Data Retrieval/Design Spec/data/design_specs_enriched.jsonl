The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The experiment was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five treatment arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Within each of these groups, half were assigned to receive a small subsidy and half a large subsidy.\n This part of the study includes 170 schools assigned to Arms 1, 2, and 3. Once schools were allocated to one of these treatment arms, the principal of each school receiving a small incentive, a large incentive, or no incentive for reducing anemia prevalence in their schools.\n Comparison group: In 65 schools, principals did not receive any incentive to reduce anemia; they received only budget support and information. (Arm 1 of the original trial)\n Large performance incentives: In 65 schools, principals received a larger incentive of 125 yuan (US$20) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. Under this incentive structure, it was feasible for principals in this group to earn incentives equivalent to two additional months of salary. (Arm 2 of the original trial)\n Small performance incentives: In 40 schools, principals received 12.5 Chinese yuan (US$2) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. (Arm 3 of the original trial)\n Across each of the three incentive groups, all schools were randomly assigned to receive small or large black grants in order to examine the effect of different amounts of resources on the prevalence of anemia. Although these funds were given in the context of the nutrition program, principals were free to reallocate them to other school functions, and receiving these funds did not depend on reducing anemia prevalence.", "experimental_design": "This study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” In the original trial, researchers began with 36 counties officially designated by the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province, and Ankang in Shaanxi Province). In August 2011, researchers conducted a canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the number of students enrolled in each. Restricting the sampling frame to primary schools with 150-300 students total, they randomly selected 300 of 1,410 eligible schools for inclusion in the study (and limited selection to one school per township). The sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools in the same region of China. Within study schools, researchers randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students from each school (10-to-11-year-old students). Researchers chose these grades to select students sufficiently old to provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent. Researchers conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at baseline to obfuscate the focus on fourth and fifth graders.\n The original experiment was designed as a cluster-randomized trial using a 5x2 crosscutting design. After conducting the baseline survey, researchers provided all school administrators with information about anemia, and schools were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental cells. The five incentive groups arms were: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). The planned methodology and specifications for analyzing the impacts of the program are outlined in the Pre-Analysis Plan. Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \n This part of the study includes only Arm 1, referred to as Group A: a group without incentives; Arm 2, referred to as Group C: a “large” incentive group; and Arm 3, referred to as Group B: a “small” incentive group. As noted, each of these arms has two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group (Group 1: 85 schools; Group A1: 32 schools; Group B1: 20 schools; Group C1: 33 schools) and a “large” block grant group (Group 2: 85 schools; Group A2: 33 schools; Group B2: 20 schools; Group C2: 32 schools). The reference group is the default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no incentives, Group A1). To improve power, researches used stratified randomization. Using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, researchers randomized cell assignment within each stratum. This analysis takes this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects. \n In the large incentive group - Group C - researchers offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between the beginning and end of the school year, with 125 yuan (RMB) ($19.40) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., two months of a school administrator’s annual salary for a 50-percent reduction in anemia). Researchers did not reveal the identity of anemic students. The small incentive group - Group B - was identical to the Group C except that the incentive was 12.5 RMB ($1.95) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., 0.2 additional months of annual salary for 50-percent reduction in anemia). When school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (student identity was not revealed). Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the contract, one of which they kept). All interventions were implemented in partnership with local education bureaus, signaling that the project was sanctioned by local governments.\n The small block grant group - Group 1 - was 0.3 RMB ($0.05) per student per day for school administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant - Group 2 - was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day. In total, Group 1 schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and Group 2 schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two installments (at the beginning of the program and half way through the school year). Although funds were given in the context of nutrition, administrators were free to allocate these to other school functions at their discretion.\n Prior to revealing treatment assignment, researchers provided health education about nutrition and anemia to all school administrators in the study. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011 and follow-up survey in May 2012 (i.e., at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed information on students, households, school administrators, and schools. As part of Student Surveys, researchers interviewed all sampled students at their schools, collecting information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities, and general health. Students were given standard food frequency questionnaires to collect information about food consumption at school and at home over the past week. Researchers measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site (at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems. As part of Household Surveys, for each sampled student, researchers collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be unlikely to know themselves. As part of School Administrator Surveys, researchers interviewed school administrators (bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Researchers also measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding of the training material. Through School Surveys, researchers collected basic information from schools (enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (teacher characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).\n For primary outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), researchers test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their interactions and three additional ones – that the small and large incentives have the same average effect, that the large incentive and the large block grant have the same average effect, and that the average effect of the large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero. Therefore researchers adjust p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993), which accounts for the dependency of the data. For secondary outcomes, researchers adjust p-values according to the total number of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five – the number of treatment coefficients in each regression). Secondary outcomes are behavioral responses underlying changes in primary outcomes (actions taken by administrators (provision of supplements or food and communication with households) and subsequent responses among students and their parents (student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its nutritional basis).\n Finally, researchers examine the cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination, considering both the sub-sample of children anemic at baseline and the full sample of children, and present both “programmatic” cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and social cost-effectiveness calculations. Researchers calculate total social costs as the sum of programmatic costs, the cost of public funds, and costs incurred by households in response to the interventions. \n As noted earlier, the full experiment involved 300 schools. The remaining 130 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement.

(Arm 3 of the original trial)\n Across each of the three incentive groups, all schools were randomly assigned to receive small or large black grants in order to examine the effect of different amounts of resources on the prevalence of anemia. Although these funds were given in the context of the nutrition program, principals were free to reallocate them to other school functions, and receiving these funds did not depend on reducing anemia prevalence.\n\nThis study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” In the original trial, researchers began with 36 counties officially designated by the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province, and Ankang in Shaanxi Province). In August 2011, researchers conducted a canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the number of students enrolled in each. Restricting the sampling frame to primary schools with 150-300 students total, they randomly selected 300 of 1,410 eligible schools for inclusion in the study (and limited selection to one school per township). The sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools in the same region of China. Within study schools, researchers randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students from each school (10-to-11-year-old students). Researchers chose these grades to select students sufficiently old to provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent. Researchers conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at baseline to obfuscate the focus on fourth and fifth graders.\n The original experiment was designed as a cluster-randomized trial using a 5x2 crosscutting design. After conducting the baseline survey, researchers provided all school administrators with information about anemia, and schools were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental cells. The five incentive groups arms were:"}, {"name": "arm_3", "role": "treatment", "description": "Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). The planned methodology and specifications for analyzing the impacts of the program are outlined in the Pre-Analysis Plan. Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \n This part of the study includes only Arm 1, referred to as Group A: a group without incentives; Arm 2, referred to as Group C: a “large” incentive group; and Arm 3, referred to as Group B: a “small” incentive group. As noted, each of these arms has two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group (Group 1: 85 schools; Group A1: 32 schools; Group B1: 20 schools; Group C1: 33 schools) and a “large” block grant group (Group 2: 85 schools; Group A2: 33 schools; Group B2: 20 schools; Group C2: 32 schools). The reference group is the default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no incentives, Group A1). To improve power, researches used stratified randomization. Using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, researchers randomized cell assignment within each stratum. This analysis takes this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects. \n In the large incentive group - Group C - researchers offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between the beginning and end of the school year, with 125 yuan (RMB) ($19.40) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., two months of a school administrator’s annual salary for a 50-percent reduction in anemia). Researchers did not reveal the identity of anemic students. The small incentive group - Group B - was identical to the Group C except that the incentive was 12.5 RMB ($1.95) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., 0.2 additional months of annual salary for 50-percent reduction in anemia). When school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (student identity was not revealed). Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the contract, one of which they kept). All interventions were implemented in partnership with local education bureaus, signaling that the project was sanctioned by local governments.\n The small block grant group - Group 1 - was 0.3 RMB ($0.05) per student per day for school administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant - Group 2 - was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day. In total, Group 1 schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and Group 2 schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two installments (at the beginning of the program and half way through the school year). Although funds were given in the context of nutrition, administrators were free to allocate these to other school functions at their discretion.\n Prior to revealing treatment assignment, researchers provided health education about nutrition and anemia to all school administrators in the study. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011 and follow-up survey in May 2012 (i.e., at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed information on students, households, school administrators, and schools. As part of Student Surveys, researchers interviewed all sampled students at their schools, collecting information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities, and general health. Students were given standard food frequency questionnaires to collect information about food consumption at school and at home over the past week. Researchers measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site (at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems. As part of Household Surveys, for each sampled student, researchers collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be unlikely to know themselves. As part of School Administrator Surveys, researchers interviewed school administrators (bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Researchers also measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding of the training material. Through School Surveys, researchers collected basic information from schools (enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (teacher characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).\n For primary outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), researchers test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their interactions and three additional ones – that the small and large incentives have the same average effect, that the large incentive and the large block grant have the same average effect, and that the average effect of the large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero. Therefore researchers adjust p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993), which accounts for the dependency of the data. For secondary outcomes, researchers adjust p-values according to the total number of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five – the number of treatment coefficients in each regression). Secondary outcomes are behavioral responses underlying changes in primary outcomes (actions taken by administrators (provision of supplements or food and communication with households) and subsequent responses among students and their parents (student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its nutritional basis).\n Finally, researchers examine the cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination, considering both the sub-sample of children anemic at baseline and the full sample of children, and present both “programmatic” cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and social cost-effectiveness calculations. Researchers calculate total social costs as the sum of programmatic costs, the cost of public funds, and costs incurred by households in response to the interventions. \n As noted earlier, the full experiment involved 300 schools. The remaining 130 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M.

The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.

ECD program introduces and evaluates alternative models of early childhood interventions—traditional kindergarten and home visits—that can be effectively scaled for implementation. A large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in rural communities to assess the efficacy of three approaches: a preschool program, the program combined with a parent academy, and the program integrated with home visits. The first intervention established a preschool program, the second included weekly home visits by teachers or caregivers to facilitate parent-child interactions and enhance the home learning environment, and the third combined the preschool program with home visits. The research involved around 7,000 children from 223 villages in southwestern Bangladesh. ECD program’s endline was completed in early 2019. Many children who were involved in ECD program were in primary school in early 2021, making them suitable candidates for IVR intervention.\n Participant recruitment process: In early 2021, a subsample of villages for IVR intervention were identified from 223 villages with prior participation in ECD program. GDRI, as the partner organization for IVR program, provided this village list. Crucially, GDRI was instructed to restrict the list of eligible households in these villages that: (a) had active phone numbers and 1-4 graders; (b) were initially willing to participate; and (c) were not involved in any interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to budget constraints, 90 villages were selected and then randomized into one of two treatments (i.e., Standard and Extended treatments) and a control group. Anticipating potential attrition, a rapid baseline survey was conducted for approximately 2,400 eligible participants. Within each village, eligible households were randomly selected. This step narrowed the sample down to approximately 1,900 households. Some further attrition occurred after before the intervention began.

It is designed to capture attitudes towards gender roles, embracing the conception of equality and the more patriarchal concept., Digital Literacy Transfer Index (DLTI): Digital Literacy Transfer Index measures the degree to which mothers introduce newly acquired digital competencies to other family members, particularly children, focusing on their behavioral shifts and role as agents of new technologies within households., Economic Empowerment: Economic Empowerment will be measured in light of the Five Domains of Empowerment (5DE) framework from the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which assesses empowerment across five key domains: Production, Resources, Income, Leadership, and Time.\n- Secondary outcomes: Children’s educational status: Educational status of the children will be measured to identify whether there is any gender heterogeneity after receiving tech-based distance learning in the long run. We will measure this by using survey questions and a brief assessment test., Homeschooling: Homeschooling by mothers will be assessed through a series of survey questions designed to capture various aspects of their involvement in their children’s education. These questions will explore the amount of time mothers invest in teaching their children at home, the types of educational activities they engage in, the frequency and duration of these activities., Educational Aspirations for Children: Educational aspirations will be assessed based on the academic and professional goals that mothers establish for their children, in accordance with theoretical frameworks on maternal education’s influence on child development (Behrman et al., 1999) and sociocultural factors shaping parental aspirations (Yamamoto and Holloway, 2010).\n\nArms:\n- (not parsed)\n\nExperimental design (verbatim-ish):\nWe will use original sampling design where 90 villages were randomly selected from a list of 140 villages (out of 223 villages from ECD program) and each of the 90 participating villages randomly distributed into one of three groups, i.e., Standard group, Extended group, and Control group (Wang et al., 2024). However, for this study, we merged these two treatment groups into one as mothers from both treatment groups received similar intervention.\n\nExperimental design details (verbatim-ish):\nStudy participants: Participants of the IVR program by Wang et al. (2024) were recruited in early 2021 from a list of households previously involved in Global Development & Research Initiative Foundation (GDRI)’s pre-pandemic early childhood development project (hereinafter, ECD program). ECD program introduces and evaluates alternative models of early childhood interventions—traditional kindergarten and home visits—that can be effectively scaled for implementation. A large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in rural communities to assess the efficacy of three approaches: a preschool program, the program combined with a parent academy, and the program integrated with home visits. The first intervention established a preschool program, the second included weekly home visits by teachers or caregivers to facilitate parent-child interactions and enhance the home learning environment, and the third combined the preschool program with home visits. The research involved around 7,000 children from 223 villages in southwestern Bangladesh. ECD program’s endline was completed in early 2019. Many children who were involved in ECD program were in primary school in early 2021, making them suitable candidates for IVR intervention.\n Participant recruitment process: In early 2021, a subsample of villages for IVR intervention were identified from 223 villages with prior participation in ECD program. GDRI, as the partner organization for IVR program, provided this village list. Crucially, GDRI was instructed to restrict the list of eligible households in these villages that: (a) had active phone numbers and 1-4 graders; (b) were initially willing to participate; and (c) were not involved in any interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to budget constraints, 90 villages were selected and then randomized into one of two treatments (i.e., Standard and Extended treatments) and a control group. Anticipating potential attrition, a rapid baseline survey was conducted for approximately 2,400 eligible participants. Within each village, eligible households were randomly selected. This step narrowed the sample down to approximately 1,900 households. Some further attrition occurred after before the intervention began. The final sample included 596 participants in the Standard treatment group, 586 in the Extended treatment group, and 581 in the control group.\n\nSample sizes (as reported):\n- planned_clusters: 90 villages\n- planned_observations: 1763 children-mother dyads\n- by_arm: Treatment: T1: Standard (30 villages; n=596) + T2: Extended (30 villages; n=586) \nControl: Control (30 villages; n=581)"}}, "enrichment": {"llm": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5.2-2025-12-11", "prompt_version": "v3.1", "input_fingerprint": "752d81ae68c27ba82dda7a4d47e7547e28e8518665df14fce75705a3bf0329ae", "run_id": "batch_req_698fff06e9f88190b772fcafa991ea65", "created_at": null}, "derived": {"design_type": "cluster_rct", "unit_of_randomization_canonical": "village", "is_clustered": true, "analysis_unit_canonical": null, "primary_outcomes_dedup": ["Digital connectivity", "Agency", "Gender Attitude Index (GAI)", "Digital Literacy Transfer Index (DLTI)", "Economic empowerment"], "arms": [{"arm_id": "arm1", "name": "Treatment (merged: Standard+Extended IVR distance learning)", "role": "treatment", "description": "15-week IVR-based distance education program (75 pre-recorded audio lessons across literacy, numeracy, and leadership modules) accessed by mothers via toll-free number; originally two treatment variants (Standard and Extended) but merged for this study because interventions were similar.", "evidence_quote_ids": ["eq1", "eq2"]}, {"arm_id": "arm2", "name": "Control group", "role": "control", "description": "Control group from the original village-level randomization for the IVR intervention study.", "evidence_quote_ids": ["eq2", "eq4"]}], "factors": [], "assignment_rules": ["From an initial list of 140 villages (from 223 ECD-program villages), 90 villages were randomly selected for the IVR study.", "The 90 villages were randomly assigned to three groups: Standard treatment, Extended treatment, and Control.", "For the current study, the two treatment groups (Standard and Extended) are merged into a single treatment category because mothers in both groups received similar intervention.", "Within each village, eligible households were randomly selected for surveying, yielding a baseline sample and final group counts; this household selection is described but the experimental assignment is at village level."], "design_completeness": "partial", "extraction_sources": ["registry"], "notes": "Design classified as a cluster RCT because randomization is explicitly at the village level.

In total, we conduct five experiments:\n Experiment 1: Priming experiment. We randomly assign psychological primes to all study subjects. Psychological primes relate to forming ten sentences, each sentence contains of five words. There are two treatment groups (T1 and T2). In T1 all subjects receive words and sentences with non-religious content. In T2 subjects receive five sentences with religious and five sentences with non-religious content. \nAfter the priming, study subjects select their preferred information sources for different topics. There are four types of sources (media, government, academic, religious) and four types of topics (2 health topics, 1 environmental topic, 1 religious’ topic). The order in which topics appear and in which the sources are listed is randomized. \n Experiment 2: Information acquisition. Experiment 2 consists of two parts. Both parts involve a two step-process. In the first step, participants can select one out of four article titles that they would like to read. Titles reflect two different sources (Muhammadiyah vs. Nadul Ulama – two religious bodies in Indonesia) and two different opinions (pro and against smoking). In step 2 subjects are randomized into whether they receive an article that contains their preferred title (one out of four title options) or not (three out of four title options). The body of the article (three paragraphs) is identical for each subject and reflects arguments pro and against smoking. This experimental set-up is randomly assigned to 50 percent of all participants and we refer to this as PART A. For the other 50 percent of participants, the procedure is the same as in PART A, but with the exception that we indicate at both stages (article selection and article reading) whether an article was fact-checked for its content or not. At stage 1 about one fourth of the article titles are marked as fact checked; at stage 2 about 50 percent of the articles are marked as fact checked. \n Experiment 3: Cognitive load. We experimentally alter the cognitive load of subjects. Cognitive load tasks relate to the memorization of specific numbers. There are two treatment groups (T1 and T2). In T1 study subjects are asked to memorize a 1-digit number, while in T2 study subjects are asked to memorize a 6-digit number. Following this, study subjects select their preferred article. Subjects can select from four articles titles with titles reflecting 2 opinions (pro or against smoking) and 2 sources (Muhammadiyah vs. Nadul Ulama). In a second step, subjects are randomized to receive their preferred article (one quarter of the title options) vs. a non-preferred article (three-quarter of the title options). \n Experiment 4: Opinion vs. Source. Experiment 4 shall shed light on the role of the information source (religious source) vis-à-vis the informational direction (pro vs. against smoking) for the preference for information and andand information processing. Experiment 4 has three treatment groups (T1, T2, T3). In T1, study subjects see only the titles of articles though no source is displayed. Once subjects select a title, subjects are randomized into receiving their preferred article or not. The article they receive does not display any source. T2 is identical to T1 with the exception that once subjects are assigned an article to read they also see the source of the article.

The intervention was originally developed to prevent parenting problems and child maltreatment and generally improves the living environment of the child. Supportive Parenting is currently offered by 188 out of the 344 municipalities in the Netherlands. Around the 14th day after birth, a nurse who works at a child health clinic (consultatiebureau) visits every family in the Netherlands with a newborn child. During this visit, the nurse explains to all parents in regions that offer Supportive Parenting what the intervention entails and hands out a questionnaire that is used to identify eligible parents. The screening questionnaire tries to identify parents who are at risk of child maltreatment. The items to determine eligibility were carefully selected during the development of the intervention and the choice of variables is explained in detail by Bouwmeester et al. (2006). The questionnaire contains items on the following domains: parents' childhood experiences, parents' perceptions and expectations, parents' mental health, parents' history with substance abuse, parents' relationship with their partner, parents' social support system, parents' age, and the child's health at birth. \n After the screening, nurses contact families that are eligible for the intervention by phone. The nurse again explains the intervention, discusses the outcomes of the screening questionnaire, and schedules the first house visit. Supportive Parenting is a voluntary programme, where additional support is offered to parents who could use some extra help. The nurse explains to parents that children benefit when their parent is doing well, when they are comfortable and confident in their parenting, and when they are aware of the effect their own childhood experiences can have on their behaviour. Supportive Parenting helps parents be the best version of themselves, which will in turn benefit the child. Ideally, Supportive Parenting is offered to all parents, but for financial reasons the intervention is targeted. The nurse explains to parents that the questionnaire they filled out helps nurses to find those parents who would possibly benefit most from Supportive Parenting. The intervention is not a way for municipalities to monitor parental behaviour or to check whether child maltreatment takes place within the household. \n After eligible parents indicate their interest in the intervention, a youth healthcare nurse visits parents when the child is approximately 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months old. This is in addition to care as usual, e.g. the normal visits to the child health clinics. Depending on the family situation, additional visits might be planned, either as house visits or a phone consultation. Visits are generally between 60 and 90 minutes each, depending on parental preferences. For example, some parents prefer to have shorter house visits that occur more often. The nurses who conduct house visits work at a child health clinic (consultatiebureaus) and receive additional training before the start of the intervention. During this training, nurses learn all the practicalities of the intervention, such as the structure of the house visits, the content to be discussed with parents, and the material available. Nurses learn how to explain the intervention to parents and how to discuss the sometimes delicate questionnaire items with them. In Supportive Parenting, nurses focus on the ontogenic system, the microsystem, and the exosystem used by Belsky (1980) and on the concept of parental awareness used by Baartman (1996) to explain child maltreatment. Belsky (1980) argues that there are stress and support factors in the ontogenic system, which regards the individual parent, the microsystem, which includes their immediate family, and the exosystem, which regards the broader social support system. Nurses learn to identify these factors of support and stress. Baartman (1996) explains child abuse by looking at conflicting interests between parents and children. He divides parental awareness into expectations, perceptions, and sensitivity. Nurses help parents to understand their expectations of and perceptions on the development of their child. They also focus on parents' sensitivity, defined as the ability of parents to see, understand, and anticipate what a child needs and to adequately respond to this. The training teaches nurses to identify factors of improvement. For example, for the development of children, healthy bonding with their parent is important. Nurses learn how to recognise attachment styles that are secure, avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganised. They then learn how to respond to the signals they pick up on. The training includes sufficient time for nurses to practice, with an actress playing a mother who is eligible for the intervention. The Supportive Parenting training takes approximately 18 hours.\n During the house visits, nurses guide parents by open questions to indicate what their struggles are and where they would like to see improvement. The lengthy house visits give nurses far more time, compared to the regular child health clinic visits, to listen to parents and truly understand where nurses can support them best. The main topics of discussion include the development of the child, the expectations and experiences of the parents, and the social life and support system of the parents. For the development of the child, the nurse and parents focus on the health of the child, their sleeping pattern, and the relation between the child and the parents. For the expectations and experiences of parents, parents get the opportunity to talk about their own childhood. The nurse listens to their stories and helps them reflect on their experiences. This helps parents to understand where certain behaviours come from and whether their expectations are realistic. The nurse and parents use this to improve unhealthy parenting behaviours. For the social life and support system of parents, the nurse helps parents in combining parenthood with having a job, having a social life, and having a partner. It is important for parents to have a balance in their lives and it can be difficult for (new) parents to combine all these obligations. Here, the nurse and parents focus on building a network for practical and social support. The nurse helps parents to realise who they can turn to for support. This support can come from within the parents' network, from new social contacts, or from professional help. If needed, the nurse guides parents into finding further professional support, such as psychological help.", "experimental_design": "We use data from the RCT conducted in 2002. Parents are randomly divided into treatment and control groups.

The major aims of Y-CBT were to 1) use ABCDE group therapeutic model (CBT) in “disputing” – challenging and questioning teachers’ work-related irrational and dysfunctional beliefs and to replace them with rather helpful and functional beliefs [84] 2); use yoga to reduce the physiological symptoms of stress and helping the participants oust of the vicious circle of negative thoughts through Yoga “Victory Meditation,” affirmations and physical exercises.[55] This framework helped provide a targeted mind/body approach to stress perceptions, reactions, and symptoms.\nThe ABCDE formed the basis of explaining the relationships links between activating\n (A) events associated with teaching children with ASD, dysfunctional thoughts, beliefs or cognitions arising from those events (B); the emotional and behavioral consequences of the beliefs (C) [84] Then, disputation techniques (D) are used to eliminate the maladaptive, dysfunctional, and self-limiting beliefs and cognitions. [84, 85, 86] Disputation involves challenging and comparing the maladaptive thoughts with more adaptive ones. Ellis [87] theorized that the best way to counter irrational beliefs is by considering realistic and logical ones.

Traditional Yoga (asanas, breathing exercises, and meditation) exercises were used in maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

We advertise for 10,500 subjects to take into account subjects excluded due to restrictions (2)-(7) above. (MTurk would count these subjects are successful completions.) The task will be kept open on Amazon Mechanical Turk until either (i) three weeks have passed or (ii) 10,500 subjects have completed the study, whichever comes first.\n- by_arm: At the ideal sample size of 10,000, each treatment-version combination would have approximately 150 subjects.\n- mde: For version 1, we can rely on the pilot study for DellaVigna and Pope (REStud); that experiment was highly powered for nearly all the treatments, thus it is well-powered still with a smaller sample of about 150 subjects per treatment, compared to 500 in the previous study. Version 2 should have a similar statistical power, and Versions 3 and 4 should have higher statistical power based on model-base simulations and on a small pilot.\n- attrition_correlated: No"}}, "enrichment": {"llm": {"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5.2-2025-12-11", "prompt_version": "v3.1", "input_fingerprint": "f2034277fb1910601fa82bb25415b50f207a88b7b1b42e6bda3ece7c19cd1d23", "run_id": "batch_req_698fff08784c8190839b46cdf6b9bc81", "created_at": null}, "derived": {"design_type": "factorial", "unit_of_randomization_canonical": "individual participant", "is_clustered": false, "analysis_unit_canonical": null, "primary_outcomes_dedup": ["Average effort (version-specific: points in 10 minutes;

Part one of the experiment began by explaining the nature of the incentives during the program. Participants were told that an anonymous benefactor with an interest in promoting healthy living and supporting the broader community provided funds to incentivize YOTA members to attend their local YMCA more frequently. During the month of the Grow & Thrive program, a $2 donation was made on participants' behalf for each day a participant visited the YMCA, up to a total donation of $60 per person (e.g., 30 visits).\n In part two, participants were told that they might also be randomly selected to participate in SRP. We explained that if a participant was selected into this additional program, he/she would receive an email at the end of Grow & Thrive, which would: (1) list the names of everyone in SRP; (2) list their attendance during Grow & Thrive; and (3) list the total donations generated by them during Grow & Thrive. We explained that only participants in SRP would receive and be listed in the email.\n We then elicited people's willingness to pay for receiving (or avoiding) social recognition (e.g., being part or not of the recognition program) using a combination of the strategy method and the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak elicitation method (BDM). The strategy-proof method contained 11 questions asking participants to state whether at the end of the program they wanted to participate in the social recognition program for different numbers of realized attendances during Grow & Thrive, and then eliciting for each question how much they were willing to pay (between $0 and $8) to guarantee that their choice was implemented (the BDM component). The categories of possible visits were the following: 0 visits, 1 visits, 2 visits, 3 visits, 4 visits, 5 or 6 visits, 7 or 8 visits, 9 to 12 visits, 13 to 17 visits, 18 to 22 visits, and 23 or more visits.\n Each of the eleven questions had the following structure: “If I go X times to the YMCA during Grow & Thrive I would prefer to participate (NOT participate) in the personal recognition program\". Participants were then asked to state, for each of the 11 levels of possible attendance, how much of the experimental budget of $8 they would be willing to give up to guarantee that their decision about social recognition was implemented. The wording was “You said you would rather be part (NOT be part) of the personal recognition program if you go X times to the YMCA. How much of the $8 reward would you give up to guarantee that you will indeed be part (NOT be part) of the personal recognition program?\" Although the procedure was involved, we told participants that, first and foremost, it was in their best interest to answer truthfully. The details were then explained in simple and plain language.\n To preserve random assignment, as well as to minimize any negative inferences that could be drawn about those not in the social recognition group, we guaranteed that the BDM responses would be used to determine assignment only with 10% chance. We explained to participants that they would have a 10% chance of receiving an additional $8 reward in the form of an Amazon gift card, the contents of which would be used to “pay” to implement their choices. If they were selected to be in that 10%, at the end of the experiment a computer would check how many times they actually attended the YMCA. The computer would then randomly choose a number between $0 and $8. If the computer chose a value smaller or equal to the amount they would give up to receive (or avoid) social recognition for the level of their actual attendance during the experiment, then their favorite decision about the SRP would be implemented. In this case, their extra reward would either be equal to $8 with 50% chance, or equal to $8 minus the amount chosen by the computer with 50% chance. If instead the computer chose a value larger than the amount that they would give up to receive/avoid social recognition, then their favorite decision would be implemented with only 50% probability and they would receive a reward of $8. Participants were also told that each draw for each participant is independent.\n From subjects' perspective, this procedure is equivalent to a second price sealed-bid auction against an unknown bidder. Note that providing a 50-50 chance to receive the desired option whenever random draws are above participants' bids was necessary, as otherwise participants would have had an incentive to misrepresent their true preferences in the first part of the “yes/no” elicitation and then simply bid zero.\n Because others' behavior plays a crucial role in social recognition payoffs it was important to ensure that participants had accurate beliefs about others' behavior. Prior to making their decisions about being part of the SRP, participants were therefore informed about the average attendance to their local YMCA during the prior month.\n Part three elicited participants' beliefs about their future attendance during Grow & Thrive. We asked how many times they believed they would attend during the month of the experiment if: (1) they happened to be randomly selected to participate in the social recognition program; (2) they happened not to be selected to SRP; (3) if they happened not to be part of Grow & Thrive (and consequently of SRP).
