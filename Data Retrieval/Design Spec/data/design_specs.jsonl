The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicated that these divisions had high rates of helminth infection at over 90%. Using modified WHO infection thresholds (Brooker et al., 2000b), roughly one-third of children in the sample had “moderate to heavy” infections with at least one helminth at the time of the baseline survey, a rate not atypical by regional standards (Brooker et al., 2000a). The 1998 Kenya DHS indicated that 85% of children in western Kenya, in the relevant age range of 8-18 years, were enrolled in school – suggesting that the sample was broadly representative of western Kenyan children as a whole at the time. \n The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups. Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving the drugs in 2001. The project design implies that in 1998, Group 1 schools were treatment schools while Group 2 and 3 schools were the control, and in 1999 and 2000, Group 1 and 2 schools were the treatment schools and Group 3 schools the control, and so on. In 2002 all schools received free treatment. Children in Group 1 and 2 schools thus received two to three more years of deworming than Group 3 children. Deworming drugs were offered twice per year in treatment schools.\n This study uses the Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP) to test several interventions including the following: social links, cost-sharing, health education, and verbal commitment. \n Social links: Parent questionnaire respondents were asked for information on their closest social links: the five friends they speak with most frequently, the five relatives they speak with most frequently, additional social contacts whose children attend local primary schools, and individuals with whom they speak specifically about child health issues. These individuals are collectively referred to as the respondent’s direct “social links.” The survey also collected information on the deworming treatment status of social links’ children and the effects of treatment on their health, how frequently the respondent speaks with each social link, which primary schools links’ children attend, the global positioning system (GPS) location of the respondent’s home, and respondent’s knowledge of worm infections and attitudes toward deworming. \n Cost-sharing: Between 1998 and 1999 PSDP delivered free deworming pills to 50 sample schools. In 2001, they were randomized again to assign half the schools to a cost-sharing intervention while the other half continued to receive free treatment. Two thirds of the schools participating in cost-sharing received albendazole at a cost of USD $0.40 per family, and one third received both albendazole and praziquantel (depending on the local prevalence of schistosomiasis) at a cost of USD $1.30 per family.\n Health education: In addition to medication, all treatment schools received regular public health lectures, wall charts on worm prevention, and a full-day training session for two teachers from each school. The lectures and teacher training provided information on worm prevention behaviors—including washing hands before meals, wearing shoes, and not swimming in the lake. \n Verbal commitment: A random subsample of pupils were asked whether they were planning to come to school on the next treatment day and whether the PSDP workers should bring pills for them on that day: 98 percent of children answered “yes” to both questions. All pupils interviewed—including both those offered the opportunity for verbal commitment and those not offered this opportunity—were provided the same information on the effects of deworming and the upcoming date of medical treatment.", "experimental_design": "In 1998, a local non-governmental organization (NGO) launched a program known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) to provide deworming medication to individuals enrolled in 75 primary schools in Busia District, a densely-settled farming region of rural western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria.

Teachers in Liberia's charter schools will be drawn from the existing pool of unionized civil servants with lifetime appointments, and be paid directly by the Liberian government. Private operators will have limited authority to request that a teacher be re-assigned, and no authority to promote or dismiss civil service teachers. The hypothesis is that accountability can be generated through monitoring and support, rather than rewards and threats.\nNote that this hypothesis stands in stark contrast to standard labor economics theories of accountability in the workplace which have dominated the economics of education literature in developing countries. These theories stress civil service protections and labor unions as impediments to accountability (Mbiti, 2016). In response, the experimental literature has focused on solutions such as payment for performance (Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2011) and flexible labor contracts with credible threat of dismissal (Banerjee et al., 2007; Duflo, Dupas & Kremer, 2011; Duflo, Dupas & Kremer, 2012; Duflo, Hanna & Ryan, 2012). \nWe will measure the effectiveness of Liberia's 'softer' approach to managerial accountability through the randomized control trial, comparing teachers in treatment (i.e., charter) and control schools. \n BOTTOM-UP ACCOUNTABILITY (OF TEACHERS AND OPERATORS TO PARENTS)\nIn the framework of the World Bank's 2004 World Development Report on public service delivery, there is a \"short route\" to accountability (i.e., bypassing the \"long route\" through elected representatives and the Ministry of Education) if parents are able to exercise \"client power\" in their interactions with teachers and schools. Client power emerges from freedom to choose another provider or direct control over school resources. \n Internationally, the charter school movement is closely tied to policy reforms bestowing parents with freedom of school choice. The standard argument is that charter schools will be more reactive to parents’ demands than traditional public schools, because their funding is linked directly to enrollment numbers. However, there is limited empirical evidence establishing that school choice responds to learning quality in low-income settings (Andrabi, Das & Khwaja, 2008), and this mechanism may be more relevant for schools in high density locations like Monrovia than remote rural areas where choice is de facto limited to one or two schools in walking distance. Furthermore, since charter operators’ earnings are directly proportional to the number of enrolled children, it is in their best interest to increase enrollment, and retain enrolled children in their schools.\n TOP-DOWN, RESULTS-BASED ACCOUNTABILITY (OF PRIVATE OPERATORS TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION)\nCharter school operators' contracts can be terminated if they do not achieve certain pre-established standards. In the U.S. literature, this is generally referred to as a \"results-based accountability\" structure for charter schools. Operators are given a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and targets for each school. The government expects operators to meet this targets, but has not made it clear what the consequences for operators area if they do not meet these targets. \n To investigate these questions, the evaluation will collect survey data from parents, teachers, and students to measure both intermediate inputs (e.g., school management, teacher behavior, parental engagement), and final outcomes (i.e., student learning outcomes). We collect data on intermediate factors to provide insights into why PSL schools did or did not have an impact.", "secondary_outcomes": [], "secondary_outcomes_explanation": "", "intervention_text": "THE PARTNERSHIP SCHOOLS FOR LIBERIA (PSL) PROGRAM\n PSL is a contract-management public-private partnership (PPP). Specifically, the Liberian Ministry of Education (MoE) contracted multiple non-state operators to run existing public primary schools (PSL schools). Philanthropic donors provide these operators with funding on a per-pupil level. In exchange, operators are responsible for the daily management of the schools, and can be held accountable for results.\nPSL schools will continue to be free and non-selective public schools (i.e., operators are not allowed to charge fees or choose which students to enroll). PSL school buildings will remain under the ownership of the government. Teachers in PSL schools will be existing government teachers (i.e., public servants). Private providers will be accountable to the government for performance. Specifically, operators must agree to school inspections and provide the necessary data to evaluate performance. However, formal mechanisms holding operators accountable for student performance are not yet finalized.\n An important feature of PSL schools, compared to traditional charter schools, is that teachers in these schools will be civil servants. This hampers the operators’ ability to hold teachers accountable for learning outcomes and raises the question of whether this type of “soft” accountability will affect teachers' behavior.", "experimental_design": "There are eight partners in charge of implementing the program’s pilot, all chosen by the government.

Each treated school will be administered by one of the eight private operators. Since each operator has different criteria for the schools they are able to administer, each school submitted a set of criteria necessary for their schools. Based on these criteria, the universe of 185 experimental schools was split into 8 mutually exclusive groups corresponding to the 8 operators, with each operator’s group containing twice the number of schools that operator will manage. Within each of these groups, half of the schools were randomly chosen to be treated, with the rest serving as controls.\n Since the composition of students may change across PSL and control schools in response to treatment assignment, we will sample students from 2015/2016 enrollment logs, which was created prior to community awareness about PSL intervention. Each student will be evaluated as part of her/his “original” school, regardless of what school (if any) s/he attended in subsequent years.

Efforts to reduce rates of abuse often seek to effect radical normative change through intervention by outside actors. Despite concerns that outside actors often lack legitimacy with local communities, there is comparatively little research on the capacity to reduce violence from within by working with local authority figures. \n In 2016, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) Research and Development team began prototyping intervention ideas for the Becoming One (B1) intervention in Liberia. The design team started off with extensive field research to better understand perceptions of different factors relating to intimate partner violence (IPV) as well as existing strategies that communities employ to address IPV. This work identified pastors and other faith leaders as particularly influential sources of authority over a couple’s behavior. \n Based on feedback from pastors and the World Vision team, IRC created an initial set of couples counselling prototypes, which could be used in pre-marital counselling by faith leaders. After many iterations based on feedback from both faith leaders and couples, the team conducted a small 8 week pilot in Gulu, Uganda with 40 faith leaders and approximately 900 couples in September and October of 2017. Observations and interviews suggested that framing relationship skills as based in “biblical principles,” seemed to increase the acceptance and practice of new skills. Additionally, providing faith leaders with new counseling methods through instructional videos was an efficient way for many of the faith leaders to digest and then replicate novel approaches. \n The purpose of this research protocol is to provide a rigorous assessment of the potential of the Becoming One program to improve couples’ communication and financial transparency, sexual agency for women and other markers of relationship quality.\n Through our evaluation of the effectiveness of Becoming One, we also seek to contribute to understanding the causes of intimate partner violence and intrahousehold conflict more generally. \n Theory of change\n At the heart of the Becoming One intervention is the idea that individuals and couples will change their behavior when 1) they are already self-motivated to do so, and 2) when the source of advice or counsel is a person of social, religious, or political significance for them. \n Put in the negative, Becoming One does not attempt to 1) create a motivation to change one’s relationship within couples who have not already expressed some amount of interest in change, or 2) influence couples or individuals using a source of authority external to their pre-existing social networks or community. \n What theories justify this approach? Behavioral science theories suggest that behavior change is more likely when interventions seek to allow pre-existing motivations to be expressed, as opposed to when they seek to create a new motivation from scratch (e.g., Prentice & Miller, 2012). Interventions might help pre-existing motivations to be expressed by making it easier to achieve goals (through reminders, forms of social or logistical assistance), or by clarifying ways in which people can achieve goals (through simplified instructions, using culturally relevant explanations or symbols). Becoming One is based on these theoretical principles because it recruits couples who are already interested in religious couples counseling as a first step to getting married (individuals and couples have a pre-existing motivation to examine their relationship), and because Becoming One’s instruction is delivered in the language of religious text (which clarifies ways for couples to develop skills in their relationship using a familiar and revered system of belief) and in couples counseling classes with their peers (which makes it easier for couples to change with peer examples and support). \n A second set of social and behavioral theories that justify the Becoming One approach posit that patterns of behavior for individuals and communities are influenced to a relatively large degree by individuals with cultural, religious, social, or political significance or authority (e.g., Rogers & Catano, 1965; Watts & Dodds, 2007). These theories identify “key” influencers as important for activating individual changes in behavior, and under some circumstances, triggering critical mass changes in behavior within communities (e.g., Centola, 2018; Paluck, Shepherd & Aronow, 2016). Becoming One is based on this broad theoretical assertion, because it operates through the influence of faith leaders, who have high status within the Ugandan communities under study, and who are regularly consulted by community members on social and religious matters, including conflicts within households. \n We use these basic theories to justify the design of Becoming One, and to predict that participation in the couples counseling will change individual behavior and interactive couple behavior in four primary ways. Becoming One should: \n Change couple dynamics through the Becoming One curriculum instruction and example of faith leaders, specifically: \n 1. Shift couple dynamics that represent zero-sum power struggles over finances, movement and general decision-making, resulting in a more equal balance of power in the couple, \n2. Increase the use of skills within couples that do not relate to zero-sum power struggles, involving communication and conflict management techniques. \n Reduce violence, through the Becoming One curriculum instruction and example of faith leaders, specifically: \n 3. reduce intimate partner violence (physical and sexual),\n4. increase sexual autonomy and affirmative consent to sex within couples.\n On a global level, we predict that these changes will occur because the Becoming One curriculum is delivered by a religious local influencer, the messages encouraging these behaviors will be framed and justified by religious texts, and they will be delivered within the context of peer groups. For this reason, we will collect data (outlined below) to measure the fidelity of program delivery (via program monitors) and to measure treatment participants’ reactions to religious ideas, and perceptions of the peers in their Becoming One group (via a midline and baseline survey). In the survey, we plan to measure effects on a number of potential mediators of the outcomes of Becoming one, described below, in addition to these global predictors of change. They include individuals’ gender attitudes and perceived norms of the community, men's levels of emotional regulation, greater gender-equitable interpretation of religious scripts, increased financial transparency in the couple, couples’ convergence in trust and communication, and individuals’ definitions of violence.\n We also predict a number of secondary outcomes from this program related to the primary outcomes, detailed below. These include the degree of convergence in a couple regarding their beliefs about and perceptions of the relationship, a shifted distribution of domestic labor, lowered levels of emotional violence and of incidence of arguments, greater communication about sexual practices, and greater levels of time spent together; on an individual level, shifted perceptions of community norms regarding intimate partner violence, lowered levels of individual depression, and higher levels of confidence in expressing opinions publicly and in perceived social support. As a secondary outcome, we also plan to test separately the effect of Becoming One on different kinds of intimate partner violence, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence. \n Faith leaders\n The faith leaders recruited to deliver the Becoming One program completed one or two video-based trainings that prepared them to lead couples in sessions designed to develop practical skills for reducing IPV. During the training they received a faith leader guide, couples guides, an attendance and planning log, marketing materials, “I love my wife/husband” bracelets, and a tablet with copies of the videos and additional instructional materials in a branded bag to help them jump start and administer the program. They were also connected with other faith leaders who would be leading Becoming One sessions and were invited to join a WhatsApp group where they could share insights and learn from one another as they implemented the program.\n Becoming One syllabus \n The Becoming One program includes a skills-based curriculum which is meant to provide couples with practical skills for improving communication, emotional regulation, shared control over financial resources, financial planning, and sexual consent and pleasure. Sessions are meant to be participatory with the couples often asked to complete interactive activities together. Each couple is also given a guide book with additional home practice activities that they are asked to complete and report back on during subsequent sessions. The content of the program is infused with gender-equitable religious and biblical materials to inspire and reinforce concepts while also providing a relatable social frame though which to integrate them. The design materials also showcase aspirational couple identities through vivid photos of Ugandan couples. \n Number of sessions \n The Becoming One program is comprised of 12 sessions delivered once a week with each session lasting approximately 90 min. The groups were responsible for selecting a time and place that was convenient for them to meet. The sessions are organized into three thematic modules: communication, finance, and sex. These are preceded by an introductory session and the program concludes with a final ceremony in which the couples are recognized.", "experimental_design": "This study measures the effect of the B1 program through a block-randomized control trial. \nThere are three waves of measurement: a pre-randomization baseline, a midline survey approximately five weeks after the \"intervention\" group has completed the couples counselling program, and an endline survey approximately one year after the \"intervention\" group has completed the program, but before the \"comparison\" group has gone through couples' counselling.\n Every couple in the study is invited to participate in B1. Intervention and comparison groups are formed from the three \"cohorts\" that go through the program. Specifically, those randomly assigned to the first cohort of B1 go through the program before the midline and endline surveys, whereas those assigned to the third cohort of B1 go through the program after the midline and endline.

Conditional on receiving any treatment, all workers had a 50 percent chance of receiving the detailed evaluation treatment. Inexperienced workers constituted approximately three quarters of each treatment group. \n The coarse evaluation treatment was designed to be equivalent to being hired (and, thus, evaluated) by a typical employer in the marketplace. The detailed evaluation treatment was identical to the coarse evaluation treatment except that it provided the market with more information about some workers’ job performance. Workers in both treatment groups were hired and given a maximum of ten hours over one week to enter the data. They were told that if, after spending ten hours on the task, they had not completed it, they should send the file back unfinished. The following objective measures of workers’ performance were used: their data entry speed, their error rate, the date they returned the data file, and three measures of whether they had followed the data entry instructions. All hired workers were rated on a one-to-five scale using a weighted average of workers’ scores on these performance measures. The distribution of scores from the job was designed to match the distribution of scores low-wage data entry workers received in the marketplace, adjusted for the fact that a worker in the sample was more likely to be inexperienced than a typical oDesk worker. The scores were calculated in the same way for workers in both treatment groups. Approximately 18 percent of workers did not return the file or log any hours. Under oDesk’s protocol, these workers were not rated. Thus, the treatments should be considered as an intent to hire. \n The particular treatment group to which workers were assigned affected only the type of comment workers were eligible to receive. No workers in either treatment group received a comment if they earned a rating below three. The remaining workers in the coarse evaluation treatment received an uninformative comment. The remaining workers in the detailed evaluation treatment received a detailed comment if they scored at least a four and an uninformative comment if they scored between three and four. Workers in the detailed evaluation treatment did not know that they would receive a detailed evaluation until it was posted.\n The uninformative comment was chosen to be short and positive, like most of the comments in the marketplace. The detailed comment provided objective information on the worker’s data entry speed and accuracy, whether the worker met the deadline, and whether she followed the job’s instructions. Additionally, it repeated the uninformative comment, so the only difference between the two comment types was the objective information provided in the detailed evaluation.", "experimental_design_details": "", "sample_sizes": {"planned_clusters": "3,767 workers", "planned_observations": "3,767 workers", "planned_arms": "", "by_arm": "Treatment groups: 1) 476 workers hired and given detailed job evaluation; 2) 476 workers hired and given coarse job evaluation; \nControl group: 2,815 workers not hired", "mde": "", "final_clusters": "3767 workers", "final_observations": "3767 workers", "final_by_arm": "Treatment groups: 1) 476 workers with detailed job evaluation; 2) 476 workers with coarse job evaluation; \nControl group: 2,815 workers not hired", "attrition_correlated": "No"}, "keywords": ["Labor"], "additional_keywords": ["Labor Demand", "Skills", "Labor Productivity", "Personnel Economics: Firm Employment Decisions"], "arms": [], "factors": [], "design_type": null, "is_clustered": null, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": null, "evidence_quotes": [], "is_public_data_available_raw": "Yes", "public_data_url_raw": "http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/10411/20120270_data.zip"}

The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The experiment was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five treatment arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Within each of these groups, half were assigned to receive a small subsidy and half a large subsidy.\n This part of the study includes 170 schools assigned to Arms 1, 2, and 3. Once schools were allocated to one of these treatment arms, the principal of each school receiving a small incentive, a large incentive, or no incentive for reducing anemia prevalence in their schools.\n Comparison group: In 65 schools, principals did not receive any incentive to reduce anemia; they received only budget support and information. (Arm 1 of the original trial)\n Large performance incentives: In 65 schools, principals received a larger incentive of 125 yuan (US$20) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. Under this incentive structure, it was feasible for principals in this group to earn incentives equivalent to two additional months of salary. (Arm 2 of the original trial)\n Small performance incentives: In 40 schools, principals received 12.5 Chinese yuan (US$2) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. (Arm 3 of the original trial)\n Across each of the three incentive groups, all schools were randomly assigned to receive small or large black grants in order to examine the effect of different amounts of resources on the prevalence of anemia. Although these funds were given in the context of the nutrition program, principals were free to reallocate them to other school functions, and receiving these funds did not depend on reducing anemia prevalence.", "experimental_design": "This study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” In the original trial, researchers began with 36 counties officially designated by the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province, and Ankang in Shaanxi Province). In August 2011, researchers conducted a canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the number of students enrolled in each. Restricting the sampling frame to primary schools with 150-300 students total, they randomly selected 300 of 1,410 eligible schools for inclusion in the study (and limited selection to one school per township). The sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools in the same region of China. Within study schools, researchers randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students from each school (10-to-11-year-old students). Researchers chose these grades to select students sufficiently old to provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent. Researchers conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at baseline to obfuscate the focus on fourth and fifth graders.\n The original experiment was designed as a cluster-randomized trial using a 5x2 crosscutting design. After conducting the baseline survey, researchers provided all school administrators with information about anemia, and schools were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental cells. The five incentive groups arms were: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). The planned methodology and specifications for analyzing the impacts of the program are outlined in the Pre-Analysis Plan. Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \n This part of the study includes only Arm 1, referred to as Group A: a group without incentives; Arm 2, referred to as Group C: a “large” incentive group; and Arm 3, referred to as Group B: a “small” incentive group. As noted, each of these arms has two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group (Group 1: 85 schools; Group A1: 32 schools; Group B1: 20 schools; Group C1: 33 schools) and a “large” block grant group (Group 2: 85 schools; Group A2: 33 schools; Group B2: 20 schools; Group C2: 32 schools). The reference group is the default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no incentives, Group A1). To improve power, researches used stratified randomization. Using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, researchers randomized cell assignment within each stratum. This analysis takes this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects. \n In the large incentive group - Group C - researchers offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between the beginning and end of the school year, with 125 yuan (RMB) ($19.40) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., two months of a school administrator’s annual salary for a 50-percent reduction in anemia). Researchers did not reveal the identity of anemic students. The small incentive group - Group B - was identical to the Group C except that the incentive was 12.5 RMB ($1.95) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., 0.2 additional months of annual salary for 50-percent reduction in anemia). When school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (student identity was not revealed). Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the contract, one of which they kept). All interventions were implemented in partnership with local education bureaus, signaling that the project was sanctioned by local governments.\n The small block grant group - Group 1 - was 0.3 RMB ($0.05) per student per day for school administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant - Group 2 - was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day. In total, Group 1 schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and Group 2 schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two installments (at the beginning of the program and half way through the school year). Although funds were given in the context of nutrition, administrators were free to allocate these to other school functions at their discretion.\n Prior to revealing treatment assignment, researchers provided health education about nutrition and anemia to all school administrators in the study. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011 and follow-up survey in May 2012 (i.e., at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed information on students, households, school administrators, and schools. As part of Student Surveys, researchers interviewed all sampled students at their schools, collecting information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities, and general health. Students were given standard food frequency questionnaires to collect information about food consumption at school and at home over the past week. Researchers measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site (at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems. As part of Household Surveys, for each sampled student, researchers collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be unlikely to know themselves. As part of School Administrator Surveys, researchers interviewed school administrators (bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Researchers also measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding of the training material. Through School Surveys, researchers collected basic information from schools (enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (teacher characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).\n For primary outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), researchers test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their interactions and three additional ones – that the small and large incentives have the same average effect, that the large incentive and the large block grant have the same average effect, and that the average effect of the large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero. Therefore researchers adjust p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993), which accounts for the dependency of the data. For secondary outcomes, researchers adjust p-values according to the total number of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five – the number of treatment coefficients in each regression). Secondary outcomes are behavioral responses underlying changes in primary outcomes (actions taken by administrators (provision of supplements or food and communication with households) and subsequent responses among students and their parents (student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its nutritional basis).\n Finally, researchers examine the cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination, considering both the sub-sample of children anemic at baseline and the full sample of children, and present both “programmatic” cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and social cost-effectiveness calculations. Researchers calculate total social costs as the sum of programmatic costs, the cost of public funds, and costs incurred by households in response to the interventions. \n As noted earlier, the full experiment involved 300 schools. The remaining 130 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement.

Specifically, we conduct a controlled field experiment based on the standard public goods game. We modify the game slightly: farmers decide how much to contribute towards the purchase of a soil fertility test and associated site-specific management recommendations. Farmers play several rounds of the game; in each round they bid on a soil fertility test from a different plot with each plot varying both in terms of geographic distance from the plot of the bidding farmer (geographic heterogeneity) and in terms of farmers’ knowledge of the plot and relationship with the plot’s owner (social networks heterogeneity). \n Our study builds on a 2014-2019 research project “Integrated Soil Fertility Management in Malawi” – an impact evaluation of an agricultural extension service in Central Malawi (Maertens, Michelson, and Nourani 2019).

The entire sample of the study comprises of 960 AWCs randomly selected across 8 districts, from which we will choose the AWCs for the three treatment arms:\n • Treatment Group 1: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for two years, starting immediately after the registration window closes (approximately from ages -6 months to 18 months for the child)\n• Treatment Group 2: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for one year, starting immediately after the registration window closes (approximately from ages -6 months to 6 months for the child)\n• Treatment Group 3: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for one year, starting one year after the registration window closes (approximately from ages 6 months to 18 months for the child)\n• Control group: 240 AWCs will serve as the control group for the three treatments\n In the treatment arms, the cash transfers will be framed as to be used for maternal and child nutrition. This message will be reinforced by regular interactive voice response phone calls to beneficiaries. Control households will receive similar phone calls, but with a generic message encouraging spending on nutrition, to keep the role of messaging constant between the groups. Since households will be randomly assigned to these groups, we can compare between them to determine the relative effectiveness of getting transfers at different ages for child nutrition. The results will speak to broader questions around targeting cash transfers to mothers of young children, and the rate of return to expanding the fiscal envelope to increase spending on early childhood nutrition.", "sample_sizes": {"planned_clusters": "960 anganwadi centers", "planned_observations": "4800 pregnant women", "planned_arms": "", "by_arm": "1200 pregnant women in each treatment arm and in the control group", "mde": "We surveyed the literature on cash transfers to gauge the range of plausible effect sizes that we want to be powered to detect. Transfers are around 15% of household income, similar in magnitude to those studied in Schady and Rosero (2008) and Paxson and Schady (2010) in Ecuador, Amarante et al (2011) in Uruguay, and Macours et al (2012) in Nicaragua. The most comparable is the Ecuadorian program, in which there was an improvement in development of 0.18 standard deviations among the poorest quartile of children in their sample; given the higher income levels in Ecuador, that group should be roughly comparable to our sample in Jharkhand. We wish to detect effects of that size for each of the questions of interest. To be slightly conservative, our calculations focus on minimum detectable effect sizes of 0.15 standard deviations. \n\nIntracluster Correlation Calculations\n\nSince our randomization is clustered at the AWC level, we must account for intracluster correlation in our power calculations. We use the 2006 wave of the Indian National Family Health Survey and calculate the intra-village correlation in child height and weight for age within villages in Jharkhand and neighboring states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa). For these variables, the intracluster correlation is relatively high, at 0.06 and 0.09. To be conservative, we use 0.09 in our calculations. \n\nNumber of Participants Per Cluster\n\nThe average number of women per AWC is estimated to be 5, but in the first round of registrations, we observed substantial heterogeneity across AWCs. In some clusters, there were as many as 17 women registered, while in others, none registered. We calculate the coefficient of variation in number of registrations across AWCs (0.665), and take this into account in the power calculations. When we randomize, we will also stratify by number of registrations in an AWC to maximize power.\n\nOne way of increasing power is to collect baseline data on variables that will be correlated with the outcome at endline (such as the outcome at baseline). We have elected not to do a baseline survey. There are two reasons that we will not be able to do this. First, it is not possible to identify beneficiaries until after they have registered, and the transfers must go out as soon as possible after registration. This does not afford time for a baseline survey. Second, the primary outcomes of interest, such as child weight and height are not possible to measure at baseline, since the child is still in utero. In the power calculations, we thus do not assume any power boost from a baseline survey.\n\nThe power calculations are different for each of the questions of interest. For example, to calculate the effect of a single year of cash transfers, we can combine the two treatment groups that receive a year of transfers and compare them to the control group. However, to determine the effect of receiving two years of transfers, we can only compare that single treatment group to the control group. For all of the questions of interest, we seek to detect an effect of 0.15 standard deviations with 80% power. We thus determine our sample size for the questions on which the sample sizes will be smallest, and then calculate our power for the other questions of interest under this sample size.\n\nBased on this, a sample size of 240 AWCs per treatment arm allows us to detect an effect size of 0.15 standard deviations with 95% confidence at 80% power. Based on this sample size, the below table shows the level of power for different effect sizes.\n\nQuestion of Interest Effect size of 0.1 SD Effect size of 0.12 SD Effect size of 0.15 SD\nComparison of 1 treatment arm to 1 treatment arm (e.g. effect of 1 year of transfers in utero vs. after child is born) 0.48 0.63 0.82\nComparison of 1 treatment arm to 2 treatment arms (e.g. effect of 1 year of transfers vs. 2 years of transfers) 0.66 0.82 0.95", "final_clusters": "", "final_observations": "", "final_by_arm": "", "attrition_correlated": "No"}, "keywords": [], "additional_keywords": [], "arms": [], "factors": [], "design_type": null, "is_clustered": null, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": null, "evidence_quotes": [], "is_public_data_available_raw": "Yes", "public_data_url_raw": "https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VAFYV1"}

The aim of this program is to increase the well-being of these families. The program was started 19 years ago in Chile and now works in 19 Latin American countries. This NGO has built almost 100,000 houses with the help of an army of volunteers. Every year, more than 30,000 youths throughout Latin America volunteer to work with TECHO. We evaluate the program in three Latin American countries: El Salvador, Uruguay, and Mexico. \n TECHO targets the poorest informal settlements and, within these settlements, households that are lodged in very substandard dwellings. TECHO serves \"irregular settlements,\" which are de\ffined as communities in which a majority of the families are living on plots of land that they do not own. These settlements are plagued by a host of problems, including insufficient access to basic utilities (water, electricity and sanitation), signifi\fcant levels of soil and water contamination, and overcrowding. The typical housing units in these informal settlements are no better than the surrounding dwellings, as they are rudimentary units constructed from discarded materials such as cardboard, tin and plastic, have dirt floors and lack connections to basic utilities such as water supply and sewerage systems. \n The TECHO housing units are 18 square meters (6m by 3m) in size. The walls are made of pre-fabricated, insulated pinewood or aluminum panels, and the roofs are made of tin to keep occupants warm and protect them from humidity, insects, and rain. Floors are built on top of 15 stacks that raise them up to between 30 and 80 centimeters of the ground in order to reduce dampness and protect occupants from floods and infestations. Although these houses are a major improvement over the recipients' previous dwellings, the amenities that they offer are limited, as they do not include a bathroom or kitchen or plumbing, drinking water hook-ups or gas connections. The houses are designed to be low in cost and easy to construct; they can be placed on a plot of land next to an existing house or as a new unit\nthat replaces the existing one. Units are modular and portable, can be built with simple tools, and are set up by volunteers working in squads of from 4 to 8 members. The cost of a TECHO house is less than US$1,000 -- with the bulk of the cost being accounted for by the acquisition, storage and transportation of the building materials, since there are essentially no labor costs. The bene\fficiary family contributes 10% of that amount (around US$100). In El Salvador, US$100 is approximately equivalent to 3.3 months' per capita baseline earnings, while in Mexico and Uruguay, it is roughly equivalent to 1.6 and 1.4 months, respectively. Importantly, added to the fact that the TECHO house is heavily subsidized, there are no exact substitutes of TECHO houses on the market that households could be investing in incrementally. TECHO do not offer the house in the market and only offer it to a group of selected slum dwellers that are in the poorest conditions within slums. Hence, even if households did not face credit constrains to get access to housing improvements, they could not get access to TECHO houses neither in the form nor at the price offered by TECHO. This consideration is relevant for interpreting the results of our study. Finally, the houses are also easy to disassemble and move to a new location. It is important for the houses to be movable because most of the families in these makeshift settlements do not have formal title to the land that they live on. TECHO managers were concerned that upgrading the value of the land by building permanent housing might induce both public and private owners to try to force residents to move in order to reclaim the improved land. However, making the housing mobile does away with that incentive.", "experimental_design": "Experimental design\n Between 2007 and 2010, TECHO implemented the program in a number of selected slums in each country. TECHO budget constraints limit the number of housing units that can be built at any one time. Under these constraints, TECHO opted to select beneficiaries by means of a lottery system that gives all eligible households within a settlement an equal opportunity to receive one of the units. TECHO first selected a set of eligible settlements and asked their volunteers to conduct a census to identify eligible households within each settlement, those with extremely poor housing conditions. The eligible households were then surveyed (baseline survey) and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups within each settlement. In general, the number of treatments represents a small portion of all the households in the settlement. For example, in around 40% of the settlements, less than 10% of the households were treated, and the proportion of treated households exceeded 50% of the slum population in only 8% of the settlements.\n In order to obtain accurate information from the households and to avoid creating any desirability bias in the treatment group, the data collection work was separated from the implementation of the intervention by contracting a highly respected survey firm in each country. The enumerators told the interviewees that they were collecting data for a study on living conditions\nand did not make any reference to TECHO verbally or in writing. After randomization, treatment households were told about the program and its requirements by TECHO offcials. Some of them agreed to participate in the program and some did not. Control households were explicitly not told that\nthey would receive the benefits provided by the program in the future, so their behavior should not have been affected by the expectation of being treated in the next round, although they may have felt frustrated when they realized that\nthey had lost the lottery. \n Since TECHO did not have the capacity to work in all settlements at the same time, the program was rolled out in each country in two phases at the settlement level. Baseline surveys were conducted approximately one month before the start of the construction work in each settlement, which gave\nhouseholds time to acquire the funds to make the 10% contribution required by the program, while the follow-up surveys were conducted simultaneously for\nall settlements for both phases in each country. \n While the settlements were not randomly allocated to phases, there is plausibly exogenous variation in the amount of time that beneficiaries had occupied the house at the time of the follow-up survey, since no discretionary criteria were used to select which slum went to which phase. Instead, the decision as to which slum would be treated first and which would be treated\nlater on depended on the inflow of census information about eligible households for each slum. When the information on the set of eligible households in each slum was delivered to the central office, TECHO organized its internal resources in such a way as to treat the assigned-to-treatment households in that slum as soon as possible. This suggests that the allocation of slums to phases depended more on the capacity of the volunteers assigned to each slum to conduct the census of eligible households than on the characteristics of the slum dwellers in that location. Phase I settlements had 24 months of exposure, on average, while Phase II settlements had an average of 16 months of exposure, for a difference of 8 months, on average. \n Our sample includes a total of 74 settlements, of which 29 were in Phase I and 45 were in Phase II. The total number of eligible households in these settlements was 2373. Treatment was offered to 57% of the households, and over 85% of those households actually received a new house. The remaining 15%\nthat were assigned to treatment could not afford the required 10% co-payment balanced across phases. Attrition rates between baseline and follow-up amounted to 6% of the\nhouseholds in the assigned-to-treatment group and 7% of those in the control group, with most of the attriters being households whose members moved out of the slum and could not be reached in their new location. This difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels. The difference between\nthe attrition rates of the assigned-to-treatment and control groups within each phase was not statistically significant either. Finally, the attrition rates are also balanced across phases.", "experimental_design_details": "", "sample_sizes": {"planned_clusters": "74 slums", "planned_observations": "2,373 households (32 households per slum, on average)", "planned_arms": "", "by_arm": "1,356 treatments; 1,017 controls", "mde": "Our outcome of interest is satisfaction with quality of life.

Respondents were also asked about their overall satisfaction with government services related to water infrastructure, local road conditions, waste collection, public schools, and health clinics."], "primary_outcomes_explanation": "We estimated the impacts of the Strengthening Civic Participation program for six outcome indices: awareness of local government meetings, familiarity with local government officials, knowledge about local government affairs, access to district government information, citizen influence on government, and satisfaction with local services. We constructed these outcome indices by grouping together survey questions related to the same underlying outcome using factor analysis. We did this for several reasons. First, estimating the impacts by comparing the treatment and the control groups on several survey questions is likely to result in one or more statistically significant impacts by chance when there is actually no impact. In other words, we are more likely to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis, when considering a series of hypothesis tests—a problem commonly known as the multiple comparison problem (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Second, since factor analysis assumes that the observed variables are influenced by a few underlying variables or factors that are unobserved, constructing those underlying latent variables (the unobserved factors) can provide useful information about processes or behavior of the population of interest. Third, grouping survey questions into a few outcome indices helps in examining impacts in a tractable manner.\n For each of the six outcome domains, we conducted factor analysis using the survey questions or observed variables that are most relevant for that domain in three steps: \n (1) We used the principal-component factor method to obtain the factor solutions. For each outcome domain, we found that only one underlying factor explained the variation in the responses to the included survey questions. \n (2) We then used orthogonal rotation to rotate the factor loadings and estimated factor scores using the regression method, which estimates a factor as a weighted sum of the included observed variables. \n (3) Finally, we converted each of the six estimated factors to binary variables to interpret the impact estimates better. In particular, if a survey respondent’s factor score was above the mean score for the full survey sample in that year, the binary variable was coded as 1, otherwise it was coded as 0.

Specifically, after these blocks were created a public lottery was conducted in the presence of district officials to randomly assign districts within each block to the treatment group (districts that would receive program activities in phase I in 2011), or the control group (districts that were to receive program activities in phase II in 2012).

We will vary (1) the conditionality of the incentives (“unconditional” and “conditional” incentives), (2) whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers (“patient outreach” and “patient provides names” conditions), and (3) whether the new suspects know who named them (“known referrer” and “anonymous referrer” conditions). \n The “unconditional” incentive will consist of Rupees (Rs.) 150 offered to current patients for each new suspect they induce to come to the center and get tested for TB. When the reward is fixed, each current patient has an incentive to refer any person who may be willing to be tested, irrespective of whether they know or believe they have TB. The “conditional” incentive treatment will consist of Rs. 100 for each new suspect who comes to the center and gets tested, plus a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB. Comparison of the effect of conditional and unconditional incentives will allow us to determine whether the subjects take advantage of incentives that do not depend on test results, and whether they have concrete information about their contacts’ health. \n To separate the effect of current patients’ networks from their ability to deliver information and persuade new suspects to get tested, we will vary whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers. In the “patient outreach” treatment, current patients will be given a set of referral cards and will be told that they will receive the reward if new suspects present at the center with the card and get tested for TB; in the “patient provides names” treatment, current patients will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they believe should get tested, and will receive the reward if the new suspect, who will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, comes to the center and gets tested. \n Finally, there will be two versions of the “patient provides names” treatment. In the “known referrer” version, the health workers will reveal to the new suspects who named them, whereas in the “anonymous referrer” version, the name of the referrer will not be revealed to the new suspects. This will allow us to determine the extent to which social stigma is a barrier to referrals. In fact, if social costs are the reason why current patients are reluctant to approach others, anonymity should remove them resulting in more and perhaps more effective referrals.", "experimental_design": "All of Opertaion ASHA's DOTs centers will be divided into one of the following 9 treatment conditions and a pure control group.

Current patients will be simply surveyed at baseline. New patients will also be surveyed and asked whether current or previous Operation ASHA patient induced them to get tested and start treatment.\n T1: Encouragement to refer new suspects (“CP-gives-out-cards”): Each current patient at these centers will receive ten referral cards and will be invited to give the cards to five different people whom they think should be tested for TB. \n T2: Encouragement to provide names of new suspects (“CP-provides-names – referrer revealed”): Each current patient at these centers will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they think should be tested for TB. The patients will be told that these individuals will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, and that their names will be mentioned to the new suspects.\n T3: Encouragement to provide names of new suspects (“CP-provides-names – referrer anonymous”): This is the same as T2, except that the current patient will be told that their name will NOT be mentioned to the new suspects. \n T4: CP-gives-out-cards + Unconditional Incentives: Current patients in these centers will be offered Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested for TB. \n T5: CP-provides-names/referrer revealed + Unconditional Incentive: Current patients in these centers will be told they will receive Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient of those whose names they provided comes to the center and gets tested for TB.\n T6: CP-provides-names/referrer anonymous + Unconditional Incentive: This is the same as T5, except that the current patient will be told that their name will NOT be mentioned to the new suspects.\n T7: CP-gives-out-cards + Unconditional Incentive + Conditional Bonus: Current patients in these centers will be offered Rs. 100 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested; in addition, they will receive a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB. \n T8: CP-provides-names/referrer revealed + Unconditional Incentive + Conditional Bonus: Current patients in these centers will be offered Rs. 100 for each new patient of those whose names they provided comes to the center and gets tested for TB; in addition, they will receive a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB.\n T9: CP-provides-names/referrer anonymous + Unconditional Incentive + Conditional Bonus: This is the same as T8, except that the current patient will be told that their name will NOT be mentioned to the new suspects.", "experimental_design_details": "Below we explain how our experimental design will allow us to answer our primary research questions. This will also clarify the marginal contribution of each treatment arm.\n The experimental variation will allow us to test for the effectiveness of a variety of incentives, in order to identify the mechanisms through which barriers to referrals and treatment are alleviated. To measure the effects of our interventions, we will estimate versions (e.g., probit) of the following econometric model:\n yij= α + βE ecnourage + βR reward + βB bonus + βN names +βA anonym + γXi +Tt + εijt \n where i denotes the individual patients, j the randomly assigned treatment condition, and t the month of the intervention. yij represents the outcome variable of interest (e.g., yi = 1 if patient i made a referral, and 0 otherwise; or yi = 1 if patient i referred someone who tested positive for TB, and 0 otherwise). The key parameters of interest on the right-hand side of model (1) are the treatment effects βk, with the constant α representing, all else equal, the response in the pure control condition T0. First of all, the estimated coefficient βE will reveal whether encouragement to refer new suspects has an effect, even in the absence of incentives. In fact, an explicit appeal accompanied by referral cards might increase the salience of the request, thereby increasing referrals. Second, comparing βR and βE will determine whether financial rewards are effective at inducing current patients to find and refer new suspects (Q1). Third, comparing βB vs. βR will allow us to assess the extent to which unconditional incentives induce strategic behavior on the part of patients to refer individuals who are not sick only to obtain the reward (Q2a) and whether the current patients have concrete information on the health status of their social contacts (Q2b). Specifically, if patients in the unconditional incentive arm behave opportunistically by disproportionally referring people who are not sick, the number of referrals made will be higher and the share that test positive for TB smaller compared to those for patients in the bonus condition. Such a result will also indicate that patients do have information about the health condition of their social contacts (or an obtain it by exerting more effort). Fourth, comparison between βN and βE will reveal whether outreach by peers (current patients) or outreach by health workers is more effective in enrolling new suspects (Q3). Since current patients may also contact new suspects when they receive incentives based on intake of those new suspects, we can also estimate differences-in-differences specifications that include the interaction between eligibility for a reward, and outreach by peers vs. health workers. Finally, the estimated coefficient βA will inform us about the role of stigma and other “social costs” in making current patients reluctant to make referrals (Q4). For example, if we found that the share of referrals who are TB positive is higher when the referrer remains anonymous, that would indicate that stigma and related social costs are indeed a barrier that is making patients reluctant to approach others in their social circles who are likely also sick. Tt are month fixed effects, included to control for seasonality effects and other unobservable factors associated with the different intervention periods. Individual characteristics (including demographics such as age and gender, and other characteristics such as personality traits, experience with the disease and the clinic, etc.) will be reported in the vector of controls Xi. εijt is the error term.

Patients in these centers will be simply surveyed at baseline and at endline", "mde": "We use the results of a pilot study to determine whether our study is sufficiently powered to detect economically meaningful effects. Since we are proposing multiple treatments, we make hypothetical comparisons between different combinations of pairs. Specifically, we compare the “encouragement” condition (T1) with the “Rs. 150 unconditional incentive for referrers” treatment condition (T4). Treatment is assigned at the center level. Because we are comparing pairs of treatments, and because each treatment condition will be assigned to 20 centers, the number of clusters in our calculations below is 40. We focus on three key outcomes of interest: Y1 = 1 if the patient made at least one referral, 0 otherwise; Y2 = N. of referrals made by the patient; Y3 = Number of TB positive referrals made by the patient. \n\nGiven the standard deviation of the outcome variables, the effects found in a pilot study imply the following effect sizes (effect/standard deviation): 0.45 for Y1, 0.58 for Y2, and 0.59 for Y3. \n\nThe intra-class correlations within centers from the pilot are as follows: Y1 ICC = 0.07; Y2 ICC = 0.13; Y3 ICC = 0.14. \nThe minimum detectable effect sizes are 0.31 for Y1, 0.38 for Y2, and 0.39 for Y3 assuming 0.80 power; and 0.36 for Y1, 0.44 for Y2, and 0.45 for Y3 assuming 0.90 power. \n\nGiven that the effects we obtained in the pilot are substantially larger than those computed in these power calculations, we conclude that our proposed sample sizes of 20 sites for T0-T9 are appropriate to detect effects of meaningful size. Note that in the pilot, the incentives conditional on TB test results delivered effects similar in magnitude to those of the encouragement condition. In the full-scale experiment, we have increased the expected value of the conditional reward to match that of the unconditional one, which we anticipate will increase its size effect.", "final_clusters": "", "final_observations": "", "final_by_arm": "", "attrition_correlated": ""}, "keywords": ["Health"], "additional_keywords": ["Tuberculosis", "Social Networks", "Peer-to-Peer Referrals", "Outreach", "Incentives", "Detection"], "arms": [], "factors": [], "design_type": null, "is_clustered": null, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": null, "evidence_quotes": [], "is_public_data_available_raw": "Yes", "public_data_url_raw": "https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/150781/version/V1/view"}

Program engagement was high; by year’s end, at least 86 percent of OK participants had checked their scholarship earnings on the OK website or emailed a peer advisor or program staff.\n Data for this study came primarily from university records containing information on applicants, enrolled students, and course grades. Researchers supplemented this with a baseline survey used to identify the population eligible for random assignment.", "experimental_design": "The “Opportunity Knocks” (OK) experiment was implemented on an Ontario commuter campus affiliated with a large public university in the fall of 2008. First and second-year students who applied for financial aid were offered the chance to participate in the program. Those who agreed were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Treated students earned $100 for each class in which they attained a grade of 70 or better and an additional $20 for each percentage point above 70 percent. Researchers focused on grades near 70 because anything worse is typically seen as unsatisfactory and because awards for lower levels of achievement are likely to be prohibitively expensive. A student with a full-course load scoring 75 in every course qualified for $2,000 over the course of the school year (10 * ($100 + (5 * 20))). Randomly assigned peer advisors, upper-class students who had been trained to provide advice about study strategies, time management, and university bureaucracy, also contacted participants. \n In late summer of 2008, researchers invited 1,056 first years and 1,073 second years to participate in OK. Eligible students are those who had requested financial aid, had an email address, had a high school GPA recorded in the university administrative information system, and had enrolled for at least 1.5 credits (half of a full load) in the fall semester. Invitees who completed the intake survey and gave consent were eligible for random assignment. Of the 1,271 students who completed the survey and were eligible, 400 were treated. Treatment assignment was stratified by year (first and second) and sex, with 100 in each group. Within sex-year cells, assignment was stratified by high school GPA quartile, with 25 in each group (the analysis controls for strata). \n In an effort to gauge subjects’ understanding of program award rules, researchers included in the OK intake survey two questions meant to gauge subjects’ understanding of program award rules. The first asked students to calculate the award amount for one class, and the second asked them to calculate the total award amount from five classes. Approximately two-thirds of the sample evaluated the example correctly. The services component of OK matched all treated students with (trained and paid) same-sex peer advisors. Peer advisors were enthusiastic upper-year students or recent graduates with good grades. Each peer advisor covered 50 participants. Advisors emailed advisees once every two to three weeks, offering advice on upcoming academic events and workshops and guidance relevant for key periods in the academic calendar, such as midterms and finals. Advisors also provided information about OK scholarships, including reminders of the scholarship calculation and payment schedules. Advisors invited their clients to turn to them for help with any academic or personal issues that seemed relevant to academic success.\n The data for this study come primarily from the university records containing information on applicants, enrolled students, and course grades. Researchers supplemented this with data from a baseline survey used to identify the population eligible for random assignment, as well as more descriptive focus-group style information collected from a few subjects after the experiment. \n Analysis compares the amount earned by the experimental group with the earnings that students in the control group would have been entitled to had they been in the program. A large program effect should be reflected in larger-than expected earnings, where expected earnings are measured using the grade distribution in the control sample. Estimates of earnings and other effects come from regressions, where the dependent variable is the outcome for a given student in a given stratum, controlling for strata effects, treatment assignment indicator, and additional controls (e.g., age, high school grade average, whether 1st language is English, mother is a college graduate, and father is a college graduate, correctly answered harder question on scholarship formula, controls who would have earned some scholarship money, hypothetical earnings for controls). Because treatment is randomly assigned, covariates are unnecessary to reduce omitted variables bias in the estimated treatment effects. Models with covariates may, however, generate more precise estimates.\n In addition to assessment of intention-to-treat effects, researchers also used two stage least squares (2SLS) to estimate the effect of treatment on participants. Some of those assigned to treatment did not really participate in the program. Researchers used the randomly assigned offer of OK treatment as an instrument for program take-up (any contact); by virtue of random assignment the OK offer is unrelated to characteristics of eligible students. Because no one in the control group participated, 2SLS estimates capture the effect of participation on program participants (Number of Courses with Grade of At Least 70 Percent, Total Grade Percentage Points Over 70 Percent, GPA, Average Grades, (Hypothetical) Program Earnings). Effects on program participants give a kind of theoretical upper bound on program effects for this particular intervention; these estimates tell us how much achievement was boosted for those who responded to incentives in some measurable way.\n Researchers look at treatment effects for the entire sample and for those who answered the second assessment question correctly to see if the effects of the OK scholarships depend on participants’ understanding of how the formula linking grades and awards works.\n To assess students’ perception of the experiment-induced motivation, the OK sign-up survey asked students to predict their average grades in two scenarios: as an OK participant and as a non-participant. To encourage a thoughtful response, researchers offered to win a $500 prize to be given to the student whose predictions came closest to the mark. After the program ended, researchers asked students who predicted no effect in the intake survey why they had expected this. This generated very low response rate. Researchers also surveyed a random sample of 50 students from the treatment group at the end of the school year (May 13, 2009), offering $25 movie gift certificates to those who responded to tell whether and how the scholarship motivated them. Researchers also assessed self-reported usefulness of peer advisor e-mails.", "experimental_design_details": "", "sample_sizes": {"planned_clusters": "NA; treatment was not clustered", "planned_observations": "1,271 students", "planned_arms": "", "by_arm": "Treatment: 400 students; Control: 871 students", "mde": "", "final_clusters": "NA; treatment was not clustered", "final_observations": "1,271 students", "final_by_arm": "Treatment: 400 students; Control: 871 students", "attrition_correlated": "No"}, "keywords": ["Education"], "additional_keywords": ["higher education", "educational finance", "financial aid", "academic scholarship"], "arms": [], "factors": [], "design_type": null, "is_clustered": null, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": null, "evidence_quotes": [], "is_public_data_available_raw": "Yes", "public_data_url_raw": "http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/angrist/data1/data/angrist,"}

In each identified community, staff members then facilitated a Participatory Wealth Ranking (PWR), in which members of the community worked together to rank households by economic status. Finally, staff members returned for a verification of the households judged to be the poorest. The program was implemented by Presbyterian Agricultural Services, a local nongovernmental organization, in coordination with Innovations for Poverty Action, a non-profit research organization. \n The basic GUP program involved the transfer of a productive asset; skills training for the management of the asset as well as life skills training, a weekly cash stipend for consumption support, worth between $6 and $9 PPP depending on family size, lasting for 3-10 months; access to a savings account at a local bank (details below in the experimental design section, as this is one of the components unpacked); and some basic health services and health education.

For each of these two additional treatment groups, a two-level design was maintained, thus creating treatment households in treatment villages, control households in treatment villages, and control households in control villages. \n In Asset-Only villages, 50% of sample households were assigned to treatment, and received only a productive asset, without skills training on how to use it, or any of the other GUP components. These households were simply given four goats, since this was the most popular asset in GUP (71% of households chose a package of assets that included four goats). Goats were chosen because most households have had or have some goats, and thus would typically be content with receiving more, and we did not want to interact with the households and give them choices for fear that such engagement itself could change behavior.\n In Saving Out of Ultra Poverty (\"SOUP\") villages, 59% of sample households were assigned to the SOUP treatment, and received a visit from the field agent to collect savings, just as in the GUP with savings group, but did not receive any other components of the program. Of this 59%, half received savings accounts and deposit collection without a match (“SOUP without match”) and half received savings accounts and deposit collection with a 50% match (\"SOUP with match\").
