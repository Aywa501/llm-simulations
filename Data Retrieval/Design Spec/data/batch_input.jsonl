The schools participating in the program consisted of nearly all rural primary schools in Budalangi and Funyula divisions in southern Busia district, and contained more than 30,000 pupils at the start of the study. Baseline parasitological surveys conducted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health indicated that these divisions had high rates of helminth infection at over 90%. Using modified WHO infection thresholds (Brooker et al., 2000b), roughly one-third of children in the sample had “moderate to heavy” infections with at least one helminth at the time of the baseline survey, a rate not atypical by regional standards (Brooker et al., 2000a). The 1998 Kenya DHS indicated that 85% of children in western Kenya, in the relevant age range of 8-18 years, were enrolled in school – suggesting that the sample was broadly representative of western Kenyan children as a whole at the time. \n The 75 program schools were randomly divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools each: the schools were stratified by geographical area (division, then zone), the zones were listed alphabetically (within each division), and then within each zone the schools were listed in increasing order of student enrolment, and every third school was assigned to a given project group. Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into the program over the course of 1998-2001, and the order of phase-in was randomly determined, creating experimental treatment groups. Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, while Group 3 schools began receiving the drugs in 2001. The project design implies that in 1998, Group 1 schools were treatment schools while Group 2 and 3 schools were the control, and in 1999 and 2000, Group 1 and 2 schools were the treatment schools and Group 3 schools the control, and so on. In 2002 all schools received free treatment. Children in Group 1 and 2 schools thus received two to three more years of deworming than Group 3 children. Deworming drugs were offered twice per year in treatment schools.\n This study uses the Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP) to test several interventions including the following: social links, cost-sharing, health education, and verbal commitment. \n Social links: Parent questionnaire respondents were asked for information on their closest social links: the five friends they speak with most frequently, the five relatives they speak with most frequently, additional social contacts whose children attend local primary schools, and individuals with whom they speak specifically about child health issues. These individuals are collectively referred to as the respondent’s direct “social links.” The survey also collected information on the deworming treatment status of social links’ children and the effects of treatment on their health, how frequently the respondent speaks with each social link, which primary schools links’ children attend, the global positioning system (GPS) location of the respondent’s home, and respondent’s knowledge of worm infections and attitudes toward deworming. \n Cost-sharing: Between 1998 and 1999 PSDP delivered free deworming pills to 50 sample schools. In 2001, they were randomized again to assign half the schools to a cost-sharing intervention while the other half continued to receive free treatment. Two thirds of the schools participating in cost-sharing received albendazole at a cost of USD $0.40 per family, and one third received both albendazole and praziquantel (depending on the local prevalence of schistosomiasis) at a cost of USD $1.30 per family.\n Health education: In addition to medication, all treatment schools received regular public health lectures, wall charts on worm prevention, and a full-day training session for two teachers from each school. The lectures and teacher training provided information on worm prevention behaviors—including washing hands before meals, wearing shoes, and not swimming in the lake. \n Verbal commitment: A random subsample of pupils were asked whether they were planning to come to school on the next treatment day and whether the PSDP workers should bring pills for them on that day: 98 percent of children answered “yes” to both questions. All pupils interviewed—including both those offered the opportunity for verbal commitment and those not offered this opportunity—were provided the same information on the effects of deworming and the upcoming date of medical treatment.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nIn 1998, a local non-governmental organization (NGO) launched a program known as the Primary School Deworming Program (PSDP) to provide deworming medication to individuals enrolled in 75 primary schools in Busia District, a densely-settled farming region of rural western Kenya adjacent to Lake Victoria.

In 2002 all schools received free treatment. Children in Group 1 and 2 schools thus received two to three more years of deworming than Group 3 children. Data was collected through pupil and parent questionnaires administered to randomly selected subsamples of students and parents in 2001.\n Social links: The PSDP Parent Questionnaire was collected in 2001 during household visits among a representative subsample of parents with children currently enrolled in Group 2 and Group 3 schools.\n Cost-sharing: Between 1998 and 1999 PSDP delivered free deworming pills to 50 sample schools in Groups 1 and 2. In 2001, they were randomized again to assign half the schools to a cost-sharing intervention while the other half continued to receive free treatment.\n Health education: All treatment schools received health education.\n Verbal commitment: A randomly selected subsample of pupils was given the verbal commitment intervention.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n1.

In contrast to sluggish growth in the public sector, enrollment in for-profit institutions has grown rapidly over the last fifteen years. Yet little is known about the labor market return to a for-profit education. Do employers value credentials from some institutions more than others? We address these questions using a large-scale resume audit field experiment. We construct fictitious resumes, randomly vary the institution from which the job applicant received a degree or certificate, and apply to job vacancies that are posted on a large, national job search website. While our primary research question concerns employers’ valuations of a for-profit versus public credential, we also test the impact of having any credential for job vacancies that do not require it. Additionally, our planned sample size allows us to examine heterogeneity by occupation, degree, and labor market. In this pre-analysis plan, we describe the structure of the experiment, and we present early results from a pilot version of our study. The full version of the study went into the field on Monday, March 31st and will conclude by the end of November 2014.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nSee the paper and pre-analysis plan for details.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nWhether an employer calls or emails in response to a submitted resume.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

In addition, all treatment individuals opened a personal savings account with a local commercial bank to accommodate possible future business transactions. Individuals in the \"Treatment-Credit\" group also contributed the equivalent of a week's labor wages to an insurance fund, which would serve as partial collateral for a line of credit. After being organized into groups of five, which were jointly liable for individual loans taken out, individuals in the Treatment-Credit group received an in-kind loan from a local agriculture supply store. Individuals in a \"Treatment-NoCredit\" group received the same DrumNet package, only without the opportunity for credit. At harvest time, for individuals in both treatment groups, DrumNet negotiated prices with an exporter and arranged a produce pickup. Once the produce was delivered to the exporter, the exporter payed DrumNet who, after deducting any loan repayments, credited the remainder to the individual savings accounts that each farmer opened when they registered.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe conduct a clustered randomized control trial with DrumNet, a project of Pride Africa, to evaluate whether a package of services can help farmers adopt, finance and market export crops, and thus make more income. DrumNet tries to convince both farmers and exporters that the other party will honor their commitment. The intervention is a package of services. Our research design allows us to distinguish the causal effect from providing agricultural credit along with the package, versus simply providing extension and marketing services without credit. Thus, the experimental design includes two treatments, one with credit and one without, and a control group. In addition to evaluating the impact of these packages, we examine whether there are heterogeneous treatment effects on the basis of prior experience growing export crops.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nDecision to participate in DrumNet, Growing of an export crop, Income, Participation in the formal financial sector, Profitability of DrumNet\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Specifically, the Liberian Ministry of Education (MoE) contracted multiple non-state operators to run existing public primary schools (PSL schools). Philanthropic donors provide these operators with funding on a per-pupil level. In exchange, operators are responsible for the daily management of the schools, and can be held accountable for results.\nPSL schools will continue to be free and non-selective public schools (i.e., operators are not allowed to charge fees or choose which students to enroll). PSL school buildings will remain under the ownership of the government. Teachers in PSL schools will be existing government teachers (i.e., public servants). Private providers will be accountable to the government for performance. Specifically, operators must agree to school inspections and provide the necessary data to evaluate performance. However, formal mechanisms holding operators accountable for student performance are not yet finalized.\n An important feature of PSL schools, compared to traditional charter schools, is that teachers in these schools will be civil servants. This hampers the operators’ ability to hold teachers accountable for learning outcomes and raises the question of whether this type of “soft” accountability will affect teachers' behavior.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThere are eight partners in charge of implementing the program’s pilot, all chosen by the government. In the first pilot year (2016/2017), BRAC is managing 20 schools, Bridge International Academies 22, the Liberia Youth Network 4, More than Me 6, Omega Academies 19, Rising Academies 5, Stella Maris 4, and Street Child 12.\n Based on criteria established by the evaluation team, MoE, and operators, 185 PSL-eligible schools were identified. 92 schools across 12 counties were randomly selected for treatment. Each treated school will be administered by one of the eight private operators. Since each operator has different criteria for the schools they are able to administer, each school submitted a set of criteria necessary for their schools. Based on these criteria, the universe of 185 experimental schools was split into 8 mutually exclusive groups corresponding to the 8 operators, with each operator’s group containing twice the number of schools that operator will manage. Within each of these groups, half of the schools were randomly chosen to be treated, with the rest serving as controls.\n Since the composition of students may change across PSL and control schools in response to treatment assignment, we will sample students from 2015/2016 enrollment logs, which was created prior to community awareness about PSL intervention. Each student will be evaluated as part of her/his “original” school, regardless of what school (if any) s/he attended in subsequent years. Using this panel dataset, we can recover the effect of PSL schools under an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) framework. Under some assumptions, we can use instrumental variables to recover the Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT)\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nAccess to schooling (i.e., enrollment rates in communities with and without PSL schools), Learning outcomes of students, Teacher behavior (e.g., absenteeism, time on task, use of corporal punishment, and teachers' job satisfaction and turnover rates), School management (e.g, monitoring visits, support and training for teachers, investment in school infrastructure and materials, and extra-curricular activities), Parental engagement in education (e.g., expenditure on education and involvement in school activities), Equity, as measured by the socio-economic composition of students who access PSL schools, Equity, as measured by spillover effects on nearby non-PSL schools\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

In Kenya they are available in government clinics and retail drug stores. Public health clinics are often out of stock while the drug is unaffordable for the poor at full retail price. Subsidizing the drugs at the retail level can make the drug affordable but at the risk of over-treatment. The study attempts two interventions to test the trade-off between overtreatment and underteatment with ACTs.\n Sample households are assigned to one of three treatment arms. In the first treatment arm, households received vouchers to purchase ACTs at full price from their nearest drug store. In the second treatment arm, the ACTs are subsidized at 92%, 88% or 80%. In the third treatment arm, households received subsidized rapid diagnostic malaria tests (RDT) in addition to the ACT subsidies. \n In order to find out what fraction of people buying ACTs were truly malaria positive—a proxy for how well an ACT subsidy would be targeted—the researchers also selected a random subset of the households in all treatment groups to receive the offer of a “surprise” free RDT after they completed their transaction at the drug shop.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nFour rural drug stores, in a rural market setting, were selected. All households within a 4 km radius catchment area were sampled at baseline. At the end of the survey, the household was informed of its treatment status (full price ACT, ACT subsidy or ACT+RDT subsidy) and a voucher given accordingly. Each household was given two vouchers for ACT and two for RDT (if applicable) that could be redeemed at the study drug store. The drug dispensed was specific to the age of the patient. All ACTs and RDTs were provided by trained study officers posted at the drug shop for the duration of the study.\n Additionally, to test what proportion of patients buying ACT was actually positive for malaria, a random subsample was given the option of a free RDT test after they had redeemed their ACT voucher. If the patient had not come to the drug store, the officer went to the patient’s home to administer the test. During the endline survey, administered about four months after the vouchers were distributed, households were informed the study was ending and all vouchers were collected back.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe ultimate aim in this trial is to study how retail sector ACT subsidies impact both under-treatment (UT , the share of true malaria illnesses that are not treated with ACTs) and over-treatment ( OT , the share of non-malaria illnesses that are treated with ACTs). Since collecting the data to directly measure these outcomes was not logistically feasible, UT and OT are estimated indirectly by measuring:, 1) Access: the share of all illness episodes treated with an ACT, 2) Targeting: the share of ACT takers who are actually malaria positive\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

In this study 200 randomly selected natural springs were given protection by infrastructure construction, installing fencing and drainage, and organizing a user maintenance committee. After the protection, water quality at the spring and user homes was checked along with other household health indicators to see whether the protection had any impact in improving water quality at source and health of the users.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nSprings for this study were selected from the universe of 535 unprotected springs in Busia and Butere districts. Technical staff visited each site to determine which springs were suitable for protection. Springs known to be seasonally dry were eliminated, as were sites with upstream contaminants (e.g., latrines, graves). From the remaining suitable springs, 200 were randomly selected (using a computer random number generator) to receive protection. The water quality improvement construction was done by partner NGO, International Child Support, over a period of four years. Springs completed in round 1 and round 2 were considered treatment springs and the rest comparison. This resulted in 91 treatment and 93 comparison springs in the final sample.\n Users at each spring were asked to name others who also used the spring. When a household was named by two different respondents, it was designated as a “spring user”. Seven to eight households were randomly selected from the “spring user” list of each spring to be included in the sample.

The objectives of SPES are to: augment income to cover the costs of education through an employment bridging program; keep youth in school and finish education where employers pay 60% of the beneficiaries and government (through DOLE) pays 40%; and increase school retention and graduation rate of the target beneficiaries. For 20-52 working days, students and out-of-school youth (OSY) who are 15-25 years old may apply for SPES, provided they are poor but deserving students who want to pursue education. To participate in the program, family income (including the applicant’s) may not exceed the regional poverty threshold for a family of six (6); the applicant must have obtained an average passing grade during the previous term or school year; the applicant must show good moral character as certified by the Barangay Chairman in their area; and the applicant must intend to enroll in any secondary, tertiary or tech-vocational educational institution.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe will conduct an oversubscription randomized field experiment to identify the causal impact of the SPES program. Eligible applicants will be randomized into a treatment group invited to enroll in the program and a control group. This initial lottery will exempt a small number of applicants who have previously participated in SPES. For all applicants, including those exempt from the initial lottery, we will work with the implementing partners to randomly assign accepted applicants to available jobs, subject to applicants meeting any job requirements set for each position. Those in the control group will be prohibited from joining SPES for one year. We will then randomly select a subset of control and treatment group students to be a part of our study, aiming for equal division on average between treatment and control groups to maximize power. Based on power calculations, 4,000 will be assigned to control and 4,000 to treatment. The exact treatment-to-control ratios and the ratio of sample size to number of applicants will vary at the municipal level because the oversubscription rate will also vary. Screening more applicants than we include in the study will enable us to be flexible to variations in the oversubscription rate and to maximize cost efficiency by having equally sized treatment and control groups.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe primary focus of the evaluation will be to assess the effects of SPES on students’ school participation and labor market outcomes. The primary outcomes of interest include the following:, Education: share of applicants enrolled in school, share graduated (from high school and from college), share dropout, grade repetition, time to degree, and grades (general weighted average)., Employment: share employed, share employed in formal sector, share employed in “vulnerable employment” (self-employed or unpaid family businesses), share currently looking for work, and duration of job search., The secondary outcomes of interest include the impact of SPES on students’ incomes and expenditures, on students’ earnings in the short and medium run, and on education spending. We will also measure the impact of SPES on employability, as assessed by subjective measures of individuals’ self-empowerment, self-esteem, aspirations, and labor market perceptions:, Income: SPES earnings, self-reported individual income., Consumption: Education spending, non-education spending., Employability: Index measures of self-empowerment and self-esteem, aspirations, labor market perceptions.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The fundamental goal is to provide humanitarian assistance directly using a modality that is not easily captured by an authoritarian government hostile to western powers - the Taliban. The situation in Afghanistan is dire; the UNDP estimates that an astonishing 97% of Afghans are at risk of falling beneath the poverty line, fueling hunger, malnutrition, and increased migration borne of desperation. Our team has secured funding to provide transfers of 4,000 AFA every two weeks to around 2,400 Afghan women for two months. Beneficiaries will be randomized into two groups. The first group of about 1,200 participants will receive payments immediately, the remaining participants in the second group will start receiving payments after two months at which point payments to the first group will conclude. The study focuses on impacts on immediate food and humanitarian needs and on whether the payments are captured by the Taliban.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe aim to recruit around 2400 vulnerable women across three cities in Afghanistan: Kabul, Mazar and Herat. Each of these women will get four semi-monthly 4000 AFA aid payments, paid directly to their digital wallets. These women will be then randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group (treatment) will receive the four payments first, while the second group (control) will receive the four payments after the treatment group has finished receiving their aid payments. We will stratify the treatment assignment by neighbourhood and our main outcome variable.\nWe will have two additional experimental exercises. In one of these, we will randomize the timing of the follow-up calls to participants. This will generate exogenous variation in the amount of days that an individual has to wait to be called since receiving a payment, which will allow us to investigate how reporting varies with the time passed since receiving the aid payments. In the other exercise, we will assess the extent to which experimenter demands play a role in our setting. To do so, we will randomize whether participants receive a short message stating what we are expecting to see in our results (improvements in measures of need) when completing one round of follow-up surveys or not. We will then compare the results between “primed” and “non-primed” participants.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nOur primary outcomes will be grouped in three broad categories: needs, informal taxation and economic/wellbeing outcomes. In terms of needs, we will focus on participants’ nutrition (e.g. in how many days have they skipped meals) and access to medicine. In terms of aid capture, we will measure whether the aid payments are (partly or completely) captured either by local government officials/community leaders or other members of the household. In terms of economic/wellbeing outcomes, we will focus on how participants assess their economic situation, their optimism and life satisfaction.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nWe will also conduct several descriptive exercises. These include questions related to how participants interacted with the digital payments app and the presence of any hurdles using it, how the aid payments were used, characterizing the population (e.g. whether they are credit constrained and whether they have any experience with mobile mobile or formal banking), and whether spillovers are likely to be a cause of concern in this setting. Moreover, we will compare the characteristics of our sample to a different sample of 5000 digitally-literate women recruited via digital channels that will receive smaller payments (non–experimentally).\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Efforts to reduce rates of abuse often seek to effect radical normative change through intervention by outside actors. Despite concerns that outside actors often lack legitimacy with local communities, there is comparatively little research on the capacity to reduce violence from within by working with local authority figures. \n In 2016, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) Research and Development team began prototyping intervention ideas for the Becoming One (B1) intervention in Liberia. The design team started off with extensive field research to better understand perceptions of different factors relating to intimate partner violence (IPV) as well as existing strategies that communities employ to address IPV. This work identified pastors and other faith leaders as particularly influential sources of authority over a couple’s behavior. \n Based on feedback from pastors and the World Vision team, IRC created an initial set of couples counselling prototypes, which could be used in pre-marital counselling by faith leaders. After many iterations based on feedback from both faith leaders and couples, the team conducted a small 8 week pilot in Gulu, Uganda with 40 faith leaders and approximately 900 couples in September and October of 2017. Observations and interviews suggested that framing relationship skills as based in “biblical principles,” seemed to increase the acceptance and practice of new skills. Additionally, providing faith leaders with new counseling methods through instructional videos was an efficient way for many of the faith leaders to digest and then replicate novel approaches. \n The purpose of this research protocol is to provide a rigorous assessment of the potential of the Becoming One program to improve couples’ communication and financial transparency, sexual agency for women and other markers of relationship quality.\n Through our evaluation of the effectiveness of Becoming One, we also seek to contribute to understanding the causes of intimate partner violence and intrahousehold conflict more generally. \n Theory of change\n At the heart of the Becoming One intervention is the idea that individuals and couples will change their behavior when 1) they are already self-motivated to do so, and 2) when the source of advice or counsel is a person of social, religious, or political significance for them. \n Put in the negative, Becoming One does not attempt to 1) create a motivation to change one’s relationship within couples who have not already expressed some amount of interest in change, or 2) influence couples or individuals using a source of authority external to their pre-existing social networks or community. \n What theories justify this approach? Behavioral science theories suggest that behavior change is more likely when interventions seek to allow pre-existing motivations to be expressed, as opposed to when they seek to create a new motivation from scratch (e.g., Prentice & Miller, 2012). Interventions might help pre-existing motivations to be expressed by making it easier to achieve goals (through reminders, forms of social or logistical assistance), or by clarifying ways in which people can achieve goals (through simplified instructions, using culturally relevant explanations or symbols). Becoming One is based on these theoretical principles because it recruits couples who are already interested in religious couples counseling as a first step to getting married (individuals and couples have a pre-existing motivation to examine their relationship), and because Becoming One’s instruction is delivered in the language of religious text (which clarifies ways for couples to develop skills in their relationship using a familiar and revered system of belief) and in couples counseling classes with their peers (which makes it easier for couples to change with peer examples and support). \n A second set of social and behavioral theories that justify the Becoming One approach posit that patterns of behavior for individuals and communities are influenced to a relatively large degree by individuals with cultural, religious, social, or political significance or authority (e.g., Rogers & Catano, 1965; Watts & Dodds, 2007). These theories identify “key” influencers as important for activating individual changes in behavior, and under some circumstances, triggering critical mass changes in behavior within communities (e.g., Centola, 2018; Paluck, Shepherd & Aronow, 2016). Becoming One is based on this broad theoretical assertion, because it operates through the influence of faith leaders, who have high status within the Ugandan communities under study, and who are regularly consulted by community members on social and religious matters, including conflicts within households. \n We use these basic theories to justify the design of Becoming One, and to predict that participation in the couples counseling will change individual behavior and interactive couple behavior in four primary ways. Becoming One should: \n Change couple dynamics through the Becoming One curriculum instruction and example of faith leaders, specifically: \n 1. Shift couple dynamics that represent zero-sum power struggles over finances, movement and general decision-making, resulting in a more equal balance of power in the couple, \n2. Increase the use of skills within couples that do not relate to zero-sum power struggles, involving communication and conflict management techniques. \n Reduce violence, through the Becoming One curriculum instruction and example of faith leaders, specifically: \n 3. reduce intimate partner violence (physical and sexual),\n4. increase sexual autonomy and affirmative consent to sex within couples.\n On a global level, we predict that these changes will occur because the Becoming One curriculum is delivered by a religious local influencer, the messages encouraging these behaviors will be framed and justified by religious texts, and they will be delivered within the context of peer groups. For this reason, we will collect data (outlined below) to measure the fidelity of program delivery (via program monitors) and to measure treatment participants’ reactions to religious ideas, and perceptions of the peers in their Becoming One group (via a midline and baseline survey). In the survey, we plan to measure effects on a number of potential mediators of the outcomes of Becoming one, described below, in addition to these global predictors of change. They include individuals’ gender attitudes and perceived norms of the community, men's levels of emotional regulation, greater gender-equitable interpretation of religious scripts, increased financial transparency in the couple, couples’ convergence in trust and communication, and individuals’ definitions of violence.\n We also predict a number of secondary outcomes from this program related to the primary outcomes, detailed below. These include the degree of convergence in a couple regarding their beliefs about and perceptions of the relationship, a shifted distribution of domestic labor, lowered levels of emotional violence and of incidence of arguments, greater communication about sexual practices, and greater levels of time spent together; on an individual level, shifted perceptions of community norms regarding intimate partner violence, lowered levels of individual depression, and higher levels of confidence in expressing opinions publicly and in perceived social support. As a secondary outcome, we also plan to test separately the effect of Becoming One on different kinds of intimate partner violence, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence. \n Faith leaders\n The faith leaders recruited to deliver the Becoming One program completed one or two video-based trainings that prepared them to lead couples in sessions designed to develop practical skills for reducing IPV. During the training they received a faith leader guide, couples guides, an attendance and planning log, marketing materials, “I love my wife/husband” bracelets, and a tablet with copies of the videos and additional instructional materials in a branded bag to help them jump start and administer the program. They were also connected with other faith leaders who would be leading Becoming One sessions and were invited to join a WhatsApp group where they could share insights and learn from one another as they implemented the program.\n Becoming One syllabus \n The Becoming One program includes a skills-based curriculum which is meant to provide couples with practical skills for improving communication, emotional regulation, shared control over financial resources, financial planning, and sexual consent and pleasure. Sessions are meant to be participatory with the couples often asked to complete interactive activities together. Each couple is also given a guide book with additional home practice activities that they are asked to complete and report back on during subsequent sessions. The content of the program is infused with gender-equitable religious and biblical materials to inspire and reinforce concepts while also providing a relatable social frame though which to integrate them. The design materials also showcase aspirational couple identities through vivid photos of Ugandan couples. \n Number of sessions \n The Becoming One program is comprised of 12 sessions delivered once a week with each session lasting approximately 90 min. The groups were responsible for selecting a time and place that was convenient for them to meet. The sessions are organized into three thematic modules: communication, finance, and sex. These are preceded by an introductory session and the program concludes with a final ceremony in which the couples are recognized.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThis study measures the effect of the B1 program through a block-randomized control trial. \nThere are three waves of measurement: a pre-randomization baseline, a midline survey approximately five weeks after the \"intervention\" group has completed the couples counselling program, and an endline survey approximately one year after the \"intervention\" group has completed the program, but before the \"comparison\" group has gone through couples' counselling.\n Every couple in the study is invited to participate in B1. Intervention and comparison groups are formed from the three \"cohorts\" that go through the program. Specifically, those randomly assigned to the first cohort of B1 go through the program before the midline and endline surveys, whereas those assigned to the third cohort of B1 go through the program after the midline and endline. The design is not a typical \"stepped-wedge,\" insofar as the outcomes of the second cohort, who go through B1 some time after the midline but before the endline, are not directly measured as part of the main experimental comparison. Rather, the creation of a second cohort makes feasible the one-year delay between the baseline survey and the eventual entry of the third cohort into B1.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nOur main analyses focus on four outcomes that combine many theoretically-related measures:, 1. Intimate Partner Violence. A binary indicator that is 1 if the female partner has experienced any of ten types of physical or sexual violence over the five months preceding the midline survey, and 0 otherwise. We expect that the ITT effect is negative and so will conduct a one-sided (lower-tailed) test., 2. Control and Decision-Making. An index of several groups of items, each of which is coded to vary between 0 and 1. The groups include decision-making about household finances and purchasing decisions, financial control, and social control. When at 0, this implies the female partner experiences all forms of financial and social control, and both partners perceive her to be excluded from all decision-making. When it is at 1, this implies the female partner does not report experiencing any forms of financial or social control, and is involved in all aspects of decision-making. We expect that the ITT effect is positive, and will conduct an upper-tailed test of the null hypothesis., 3. Sexual Consent and Autonomy. An index of items, mostly answered by the female partner but one answered by the male partner, about whether the male partner takes a non-coercive strategy when his partner refuses sex, and how the female partner feels about her control over decisions about and initiation of sex. The responses are coded to vary between 0 and 1. When the index is at 0, this implies that the female partner reports sexual coercion across all of the domains, and that the male partner reports coercive behavior. When it is at 1, this implies the absence of coercion., 4. Communication and Conflict Management Techniques. An index of items addressing a broad range of domains of communication, answered by both female and male partners. The domains include communication about sex, about daily events and companionship, and techniques for de-escalation when arguing about difficult topics. When the index is at 0, this implies that the partners agree that they have had no supportive or open communication or techniques for peaceful or de-escalating communication across many domains. When it is at 1, this implies the partners agree that they communicate with supportive or open communication or techniques for peaceful or de-escalating communication across all the domains.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nWe group secondary outcomes into two categories: those that we hypothesize are possible mediators between Becoming One and any effects on our primary outcomes, and those that we consider to be additional outcomes that participating in Becoming One may influence, but are not of primary concern., We hypothesize that the following variables are potential mediators: Gender attitudes and norms, men’s emotional regulation, religious interpretation, financial transparency, convergence in couples’ trust and communication, and individuals’ definitions of violence, The list of secondary outcomes is:, The degree of convergence in a couple regarding their beliefs about and perceptions of the relationship, a shifted distribution of domestic labor and of perceptions of community norms regarding intimate partner violence; within the couple, lowered levels of emotional violence and of incidence of arguments, greater communication about sexual practices, higher levels of time spent together; on an individual level, shifts in perceived community norms, lowered levels of individual depression and higher levels of confidence in expressing opinions publicly and in perceived social support. As a secondary outcome, we also plan to test separately the effect of Becoming One on different kinds of intimate partner violence, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence.\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

A health transfer of 644 Lempiras per year (about US$40) was available to children under 3 and pregnant mothers who regularly attended health centers. Households were eligible to receive up to 3 education transfers and up to 2 health transfers.\n The 70 municipalities were divided into 5 quintiles based on mean height-for-age, and 8 of 14 municipalities in each quintile were randomly selected to receive transfers.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nUnder PRAF-II, a revamp of the first Programa de Asignación Familiar (PRAF), eligible families could receive two kinds of cash transfers. An education transfer of 812 Lempiras/year (about US$50) was available to families with children ages 6 to 12 who were enrolled and regularly attended grades 1-4. A health transfer of 644 Lempiras/year (about US$40) was available to families with children under 3 and pregnant mothers who regularly attended health centers. In practice, school enrollment (but not attendance) was enforced as a condition of the payments, while no health benefits were suspended for failure to attend health centers.\n PRAF-II also planned to give cash transfers to schools and health centers of US$4,000 and US$6,000 respectively. However, the distribution of these funds was extremely limited in practice, mostly due to legal hurdles in forming community groups authorized to administer funds. \n To target the program, municipalities were ranked based on average height-for-age scores of first graders, and the bottom 70 municipalities were selected for inclusion. The municipalities were then randomly allocated into four groups (as mentioned above under intervention details). For those municipalities in the treatment group, cash transfers were made available for children aged 6-12, who had not yet completed 4th grade.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe main outcomes studied are whether an eligible child for the educational transfer is:, Enrolled in school, Works outside home, Works only in home, See Table A.1 in the attached document.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The workers were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) a treatment group which was hired and given an evaluation like those traditionally given in the marketplace, (2) a treatment group which was hired and given a more detailed evaluation, and (3) a control group which was not hired and thus did not receive any evaluation.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWorkers were first randomized into either the control group or one of two treatment groups: the detailed evaluation or the coarse evaluation treatment group. Randomization into any treatment group was stratified on prior oDesk experience, such that workers without oDesk experience had a higher chance of being in any treatment group (32 percent) than experienced workers (15 percent). Conditional on receiving any treatment, all workers had a 50 percent chance of receiving the detailed evaluation treatment. Inexperienced workers constituted approximately three quarters of each treatment group. \n The coarse evaluation treatment was designed to be equivalent to being hired (and, thus, evaluated) by a typical employer in the marketplace. The detailed evaluation treatment was identical to the coarse evaluation treatment except that it provided the market with more information about some workers’ job performance. Workers in both treatment groups were hired and given a maximum of ten hours over one week to enter the data. They were told that if, after spending ten hours on the task, they had not completed it, they should send the file back unfinished. The following objective measures of workers’ performance were used: their data entry speed, their error rate, the date they returned the data file, and three measures of whether they had followed the data entry instructions. All hired workers were rated on a one-to-five scale using a weighted average of workers’ scores on these performance measures. The distribution of scores from the job was designed to match the distribution of scores low-wage data entry workers received in the marketplace, adjusted for the fact that a worker in the sample was more likely to be inexperienced than a typical oDesk worker. The scores were calculated in the same way for workers in both treatment groups. Approximately 18 percent of workers did not return the file or log any hours. Under oDesk’s protocol, these workers were not rated. Thus, the treatments should be considered as an intent to hire. \n The particular treatment group to which workers were assigned affected only the type of comment workers were eligible to receive. No workers in either treatment group received a comment if they earned a rating below three. The remaining workers in the coarse evaluation treatment received an uninformative comment. The remaining workers in the detailed evaluation treatment received a detailed comment if they scored at least a four and an uninformative comment if they scored between three and four. Workers in the detailed evaluation treatment did not know that they would receive a detailed evaluation until it was posted.\n The uninformative comment was chosen to be short and positive, like most of the comments in the marketplace. The detailed comment provided objective information on the worker’s data entry speed and accuracy, whether the worker met the deadline, and whether she followed the job’s instructions. Additionally, it repeated the uninformative comment, so the only difference between the two comment types was the objective information provided in the detailed evaluation.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nPost-experiment employment, earnings, and reservation wages of workers in all three experimental groups\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

A sample of 383 rice farmers were then randomly assigned to the following two treatment groups and a control group: \ni) Full grant: Farmers received the total recommended quantity per hectare (on average 308.20 kg/ha) \nii) Half grant: Farmers received half of the recommended quantity per hectare (on average 156.20 kg/ha)\niii) Comparison group: Farmers in the control group received no fertilizer.\nThe two groups that received fertilizer were given a 30-minute explanation of fertilizer use, with no further training or monitoring.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nA simple field experiment which provided free fertilizer to female rice farmers in southern Mali was conducted to measure how farmers chose to use the fertilizer, what changes they made to their agricultural practices, and the profitability of this set of changes. First, a census of female farmers in 23 selected villages was conducted, in which one woman per household was randomly sampled, and a baseline survey was conducted. Detailed information was collected on agricultural activities, other economic activities, assets, consumption, expenditures, etc. A total of 383 women who had cultivated rice in the agricultural season prior to the survey constituted our sample frame for the experiment. The experiment had two treatment groups: those who received the full recommended quantity of fertilizer per hectare, and those who received half of the recommended quantity per hectare. Farmers in the control group received no fertilizer. Teams were sent to the villages to distribute the fertilizer to women in the treatment groups. A short, 30-minute explanation on how to use the fertilizer was provided - no other training or monitoring was provided. A few months after the fertilizer distribution, a follow-up survey was conducted that focused on input use. A second follow-up survey was conducted immediately after the harvest to measure output.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nInputs:, Use of fertilizer, Fertilizer quantity used (kg), Family labor (days), Fertilizer expenses, Herbicides, Expenses on hired labor, Total expenses (excl. fertilizer), Total inputs (incl. value of fertilizer used), Output:, Value output, Profits, Profits (subtracting value of family labor), Profits (subtracting fertilizer costs only)\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The price of the target product was varied from fully subsidized to no subsidy. Additionally, in\"the informed treatment group\" households were given detailed information about the similarity between the target product and the familiar product. Marketing scripts were pre-printed to reflect the 26 marketing conditions: informed vs. uninformed crossed with 13 different subsidy levels ranging from zero to full subsidy. The scripts were provided to marketers in random order and they were instructed to use them in that order.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThis evaluation attempts to estimate the causal impact of information on the effectiveness of price subsidies using door-to-door marketing. A team of marketers visited households in low- to middle- income compounds in Lusaka with water purification products. The trial varied both how much information was provided to consumers and how much the product was subsidized. These two orthogonal sources of variation allow researchers to assess the complementarity between information and subsidies. After hearing the marketing intervention, subjects were asked whether they would like to purchase either product. After subjects completed their purchase decisions, marketers asked a brief set of survey questions including one on perceptions of the products' qualities.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nPurchase of the target product\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The clustered randomized control trial will randomly select 6,552 participants from selected rural households; in 312. villages and from 6 Ghana Districts. We adopted a cluster random assignment design in order to address spillover effects that could have important implications for evaluating the overall benefits (and costs) of implementing financial incentives for vaccine uptake.\n Village clusters are randomly assigned to receive on of four video treatment arms: a placebo, a standard health message, a high cash incentive ($10) and a low cash incentive ($3). Randomly selected participants within a village will be assigned to one of the four video treatment arms. In addition, a proportion of subjects (25 percent) within village clusters assigned to one of the three treatment arms receive the placebo treatment. We incorporate placebo treatments in the design in order to facilitate the identification of both direct and indirect treatment effects that are decoupled from the delivery mechanism.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nThe experimental design is described in detail in the attached proposal document.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe outcome variable is whether subjects received a COVID-19 vaccine after the initial video intervention. We will begin measuring the outcome for all 6,000 subjects after the six-week reporting period for the Low and High Cash treated subjects.

Each village was preparing to apply for infrastructure projects as part of the Indonesian Kecamatan Development Program (KDP). The experiment randomly allocated 49 Indonesian villages to choose their projects either through a standard KDP decision-making process, in which projects are selected at two representative village meetings (one meeting to select the general project, and one meeting exclusively with women representatives to select the women's project), or through direct plebiscites, in which all villagers could vote directly at an election for their most preferred projects. To mirror the meeting-based process, in plebiscite villages two simultaneous votes were held, one in which all adults in the village were eligible to vote for the general proposal and one in which all adult women in the village were eligible to vote on the women's-specific proposal. \n The experiment was conducted in two phases. First, Phase I was conducted in 10 villages in East Java Province and 19 villages in North Sumatra Province. Based on qualitative reports from Phase I areas, the experimental protocol was changed slightly, and then run again in Phase II in an additional 20 villages in Southeast Sulawesi Province. The impact on elite capture was evaluated by examining whether the types of projects chosen moved closer to the preferences of village elites and whether the location of projects moved towards wealthier parts of the villages. The impact on perceived legitimacy was evaluated by examining a wide range of measures of villagers' satisfaction with, and perceived fairness of, KDP.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nImpact of Plebiscites on Project Type, Impact of Plebiscites on Project Rank, Plebiscites and Project Location by Hamlet Poverty Rank, Plebiscites and Project Location by Hamlet Population, Plebiscites and Project Location by Hamlet Centrality, Impact of Plebiscites on Project Location, Impact of Plebiscites on Perceptions of KDP Process.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The third intervention is an intermediate one, in which the NGO restricts the way in which the village residents participate in the provision of safe water.

The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The experiment was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five treatment arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Within each of these groups, half were assigned to receive a small subsidy and half a large subsidy.\n This part of the study includes 170 schools assigned to Arms 1, 2, and 3. Once schools were allocated to one of these treatment arms, the principal of each school receiving a small incentive, a large incentive, or no incentive for reducing anemia prevalence in their schools.\n Comparison group: In 65 schools, principals did not receive any incentive to reduce anemia; they received only budget support and information. (Arm 1 of the original trial)\n Large performance incentives: In 65 schools, principals received a larger incentive of 125 yuan (US$20) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. Under this incentive structure, it was feasible for principals in this group to earn incentives equivalent to two additional months of salary. (Arm 2 of the original trial)\n Small performance incentives: In 40 schools, principals received 12.5 Chinese yuan (US$2) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. (Arm 3 of the original trial)\n Across each of the three incentive groups, all schools were randomly assigned to receive small or large black grants in order to examine the effect of different amounts of resources on the prevalence of anemia. Although these funds were given in the context of the nutrition program, principals were free to reallocate them to other school functions, and receiving these funds did not depend on reducing anemia prevalence.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThis study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” In the original trial, researchers began with 36 counties officially designated by the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province, and Ankang in Shaanxi Province). In August 2011, researchers conducted a canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the number of students enrolled in each. Restricting the sampling frame to primary schools with 150-300 students total, they randomly selected 300 of 1,410 eligible schools for inclusion in the study (and limited selection to one school per township). The sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools in the same region of China. Within study schools, researchers randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students from each school (10-to-11-year-old students). Researchers chose these grades to select students sufficiently old to provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent. Researchers conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at baseline to obfuscate the focus on fourth and fifth graders.\n The original experiment was designed as a cluster-randomized trial using a 5x2 crosscutting design. After conducting the baseline survey, researchers provided all school administrators with information about anemia, and schools were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental cells. The five incentive groups arms were: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). The planned methodology and specifications for analyzing the impacts of the program are outlined in the Pre-Analysis Plan. Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \n This part of the study includes only Arm 1, referred to as Group A: a group without incentives; Arm 2, referred to as Group C: a “large” incentive group; and Arm 3, referred to as Group B: a “small” incentive group. As noted, each of these arms has two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group (Group 1: 85 schools; Group A1: 32 schools; Group B1: 20 schools; Group C1: 33 schools) and a “large” block grant group (Group 2: 85 schools; Group A2: 33 schools; Group B2: 20 schools; Group C2: 32 schools). The reference group is the default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no incentives, Group A1). To improve power, researches used stratified randomization. Using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, researchers randomized cell assignment within each stratum. This analysis takes this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects. \n In the large incentive group - Group C - researchers offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between the beginning and end of the school year, with 125 yuan (RMB) ($19.40) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., two months of a school administrator’s annual salary for a 50-percent reduction in anemia). Researchers did not reveal the identity of anemic students. The small incentive group - Group B - was identical to the Group C except that the incentive was 12.5 RMB ($1.95) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., 0.2 additional months of annual salary for 50-percent reduction in anemia). When school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (student identity was not revealed). Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the contract, one of which they kept). All interventions were implemented in partnership with local education bureaus, signaling that the project was sanctioned by local governments.\n The small block grant group - Group 1 - was 0.3 RMB ($0.05) per student per day for school administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant - Group 2 - was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day. In total, Group 1 schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and Group 2 schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two installments (at the beginning of the program and half way through the school year). Although funds were given in the context of nutrition, administrators were free to allocate these to other school functions at their discretion.\n Prior to revealing treatment assignment, researchers provided health education about nutrition and anemia to all school administrators in the study. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011 and follow-up survey in May 2012 (i.e., at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed information on students, households, school administrators, and schools. As part of Student Surveys, researchers interviewed all sampled students at their schools, collecting information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities, and general health. Students were given standard food frequency questionnaires to collect information about food consumption at school and at home over the past week. Researchers measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site (at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems. As part of Household Surveys, for each sampled student, researchers collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be unlikely to know themselves. As part of School Administrator Surveys, researchers interviewed school administrators (bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Researchers also measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding of the training material. Through School Surveys, researchers collected basic information from schools (enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (teacher characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).\n For primary outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), researchers test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their interactions and three additional ones – that the small and large incentives have the same average effect, that the large incentive and the large block grant have the same average effect, and that the average effect of the large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero. Therefore researchers adjust p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993), which accounts for the dependency of the data. For secondary outcomes, researchers adjust p-values according to the total number of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five – the number of treatment coefficients in each regression). Secondary outcomes are behavioral responses underlying changes in primary outcomes (actions taken by administrators (provision of supplements or food and communication with households) and subsequent responses among students and their parents (student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its nutritional basis).\n Finally, researchers examine the cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination, considering both the sub-sample of children anemic at baseline and the full sample of children, and present both “programmatic” cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and social cost-effectiveness calculations. Researchers calculate total social costs as the sum of programmatic costs, the cost of public funds, and costs incurred by households in response to the interventions. \n As noted earlier, the full experiment involved 300 schools. The remaining 130 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M.

How to (cost-)effectively provide such information – whether weather forecasts or management recommendations – is, therefore, an important question for governments. In this research project, we study to what extent information about soil fertility and the accompanying management recommendations can be funded through collective contributions, and the degree to which individual contributions towards purchasing agricultural information will differ depending on the actual and perceived heterogeneity in village soils and on within-village social relationships. To study these questions, we conduct a modified public goods experiment in the Dowa and Kasungu districts of Central Malawi and collect associated survey data and soil samples.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe fieldwork is designed to study the degree to which individual contributions towards purchasing soil fertility tests and accompanying management recommendations will differ depending on the actual and perceived heterogeneity across sampled plots – both in terms of geography and social networks. Specifically, we conduct a controlled field experiment based on the standard public goods game. We modify the game slightly: farmers decide how much to contribute towards the purchase of a soil fertility test and associated site-specific management recommendations. Farmers play several rounds of the game; in each round they bid on a soil fertility test from a different plot with each plot varying both in terms of geographic distance from the plot of the bidding farmer (geographic heterogeneity) and in terms of farmers’ knowledge of the plot and relationship with the plot’s owner (social networks heterogeneity). \n Our study builds on a 2014-2019 research project “Integrated Soil Fertility Management in Malawi” – an impact evaluation of an agricultural extension service in Central Malawi (Maertens, Michelson, and Nourani 2019). The 2014-2019 extension project was carried out in 250 randomly selected villages in two Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) where the implementer had not worked previous to 2014: Mthumtama in Kasungu district and Chibvala in Dowa district. Our project randomly selected 30 of the control villages from the 2014-2019 project villages: 15 in Kasungu district and 15 in Dowa district. In each village, based on the agricultural census obtained from the extension officers, we invited 20 farmers to take part in a public goods game. Only one farmer per household was allowed to participate. \n In addition to the public goods game, in order to benchmark our total contributions towards a soil fertility test, we elicited individual willingness to pay (WTP) for soil fertility information following the Random Lottery Incentive System (RLIS) method in four additional villages (two in Kasungu and two in Dowa), interviewing six individuals in each of the villages in their homes.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nIndividual and collective contributions (in Malawian Kwacha) towards purchase of a soil fertility test from a maize plot and accompanying management recommendations\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Specifically, individuals were randomly assigned into one of the following groups: (1) fixed (standard) commitment contracts without discount, (2) fixed (standard) commitment contracts with discount, (3) flexible (self-designed) commitment contracts without discount, (4) flexible (self-designed) commitment contracts with discount, (5) 50% discount coupons, (6) control group.\n A fixed (standard) commitment contract works as follows. Should the respondent decide to sign up, she would be required to pay in advance for all 3 doctor visits (Rs. 90 or Rs. 30 per visit). She would also be asked to pay an additional commitment amount of Rs. 45, which she receives back in equal installments of Rs. 15 each time she visits the doctor. In other words, the respondent pays a total of Rs. 135 up front, and receives Rs. 15 on each of 3 visits.\n A flexible (self-designed) commitment contract works similarly, but the respondent would be able to choose the commitment amount beginning with Rs. 0. As above, the respondent receives this committed amount back in 3 equal installments every time she visits the doctor.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe sample selection and randomization works as follows. Since “Hypertension Days” are targeted towards patients with high blood pressure, our study sample consists of individuals above the age of 30 who are either diagnosed with or at risk of hypertension. We follow widely accepted medical guidelines and define hypertensive patients as those with systolic blood pressure above 140 or diastolic blood pressure above 90. To identify hypertensive individuals, a team of enumerators first screened all members of a particular household by measuring their blood pressure using an automatic blood pressure measurement device. If the systolic or diastolic blood pressure reading is above the thresholds previously described, the enumerator immediately invites the individual to participate in the study and to complete the baseline survey. In the event that more than one household member has hypertension, the member with the highest stage of hypertension (stage 1 or stage 2), is selected to take part in the study. Finally, in the event that more than one household member has the same hypertension stage, the member with the highest systolic blood pressure reading is selected to take part in the study. During the same household visit in which the baseline survey is administered, the respondent was offered a commitment contract or price discount coupons to visit the weekly “Hypertension Day” in their village for 3 times in 6 months, as described in the intervention section above. Note that before commencing the study, we conducted a census in all villages in our sample and collected data on household characteristics. We used this census data to randomize all households in the village prior to the enumerators’ visit.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nPrimary outcomes: commitment contract take-up, attendance at “Hypertension Days”, blood pressure: Secondary outcomes: diet profile, health status, behavior, knowledge and perceptions, health measurements (body weight, waist circumference, BMI)\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The program required participating farmers to plant 50 seedlings on half an acre of their own land. ICRAF distributed the seedlings, trained farmers, and monitored tree survival at regular intervals—six months, one year, two years, and three years after the start of the program. Farmers were compensated based on the number of trees that were still alive at each inspection.\n There were two different selection methods: auction and lottery. In the auction group, participants submitted bids for the minimum compensation for which they would participate in the program. Sealed bids were collected and ranked on the spot to determine the auction clearing price based on the available budget and the first rejected bid. Participants in the lottery group were told the take-it or leave-it price, based on the auction clearing price (but were not informed about the source of the price).The lottery was conducted among those participants who were willing to accept this price.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe study sample was collected from a census of 472 households in 23 villages conducted by ICRAF. Households reporting less than one acre of private land in the baseline survey were ineligible for contracting and were excluded from the randomization. Treatment groups were assigned using a simple random draw. All households were invited to the allocation process and upon arrival were separated into their preassigned treatment groups. The contract details were explained in identical fashion to both groups after which the auction group was explained the details of the auction and lottery group the details of the lotter process. 85 households selected into the auction arm and 91 households were selected into the lottery arm.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nTree survival\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

First, we leverage variation in school construction to identify the effects of access to education using a difference-in-differences (and instrumental variables) design that compares cohorts just too old to be affected by the reforms to cohorts affected by the reforms in villages that were and were not close to locations where new secondary schools were constructed. Second, we randomize the provision of incumbent performance information to individuals in those cohorts and villages. In addition, we compare the effects of just informing voters about their current incumbent with also providing a temporal benchmark---the performance of a previous incumbent. To further probe the conditions required to process and incorporate such information in voting decisions, we further vary whether voters are informed of the duties of their deputies. We conduct a panel survey to measure the pre-treatment effects of education, the effects of different types of information provision, and interaction between education and information provision on electoral accountability and several costly behavioral outcomes. A variety of treatment variants and survey questions help us to separate between the mechanisms potentially driving our main hypotheses relating to the effects of education, information provision, and their potential complementarity or substitutability on electoral accountability.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nVoter beliefs about incumbent and challenger performance in office, political knowledge, comprehension of politician performance information, vote choice, costly indications of candidate support.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The machine was locked into a caddy and password-protected to prevent tampering. In addition, the ANM was supposed to stamp a register secured to the wall of the subcenter three times a day: once at 9 a.m., once between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., and once at 3 p.m. She had to both sign and stamp following a routine that ensures that only the ANM can sign. Any absence had to be recorded on the register and approved by the supervising doctor to which the nurse reports to.\n Attendance was incentivized by an announcement by the Chief Medical Health Officer (CMHO) of the district which stipulated that ANMs absent for more than 50% of the time on monitored days would have their pay reduced by the number of absences recorded by Seva Mandir’s monitoring system for that month. Further, ANMs absent for more than 50% of the time on monitored days for a second month would be suspended from government service.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe experiment uses baseline data of nurse attendance from a 2002-2003 survey done by Banerjee, Duflo and Glennerster. That data is used to ensure there is no significant difference between treatment and control groups. According to the contract between Seva Mandir and the district, the NGO would monitor tenured ANMs on Mondays - because as per decree of the District, no meeting or field activities were to be scheduled on Monday giving the ANM no reason to be absent from the center - and the contractual ANM three days per week. Treatment subcenters received the time-stamp machine and attendance registers while control subcenters continued to operate as before.\n Field officers made unannounced visits to sample subcenters to check if the center was open, whether the ANMs were present and took a date-stamped photo if the ANM was found. At the end of the month Seva Mandir consolidated the attendance data from the time stamp machine and physical registers and send it to the supervising doctor who approved any absences.

A randomized control trial approach was employed in which rainfall insurance was randomized across small agricultural firms in a semi-arid region of India in which rainfall variability during the monsoon is the primary source of production and income risk. At the start of the monsoon, the treatment group consisting of half of the farmers in the sample was provided with rainfall insurance policies, mitigating their exposure to rainfall risk. The control group was instead promised a fixed cash payment equal to an estimate of the actuarial value of the insurance policy, to be paid at the same time as insurance payouts. This compensation was offered to ensure that differences in behavior between the insurance and control group would be do to the state-contingent nature of the insurance, rather than any wealth effects arising from the expected value of the insurance. After the growing season, a follow-up survey was conducted of each household which collected demographic data, information on livestock, financial assets (including savings, loans, and insurance), agricultural investments and production decisions during the monsoon, and attitudes towards and expectations of weather and insurance payout, and risk-coping behavior. \n The project also involved a follow-up experiment which sought to understand how consumers value these complex insurance products and to provide insight into their long-run commercial viability. An interviewer would visit each household after the first experiment and offer the chance to participate in a game in which they would have the opportunity to purchase rainfall insurance policies at a discounted price. The subject would have a chance to study the details of several insurance policies, and then record, in rupees, their willingness to pay for it. Only one of these policies would in fact be available for sale, and would be revealed only after the subject had stated willingness to pay for all policies. If the subject's bid were greater than or equal to the offer price, the subject would purchase the policy. If the subject's bid was less than the offer price, no insurance policy would be sold.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nMain experiment:, Cumulative \"index\" rainfall for each policy relative to cumulative total rainfall, Agricultural investment decisions during treatment period, Local average treatment effect of insurance treatment on agricultural investments during treatment period, Average treatment effect estimates for cash crops by individual input type, Willingness-to-pay experiment:, Average bid for each insurance policy, Farmer willingness to pay for each insurance policy\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Figure 1 summarizes the experimental design. The entire sample of the study comprises of 960 AWCs randomly selected across 8 districts, from which we will choose the AWCs for the three treatment arms:\n • Treatment Group 1: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for two years, starting immediately after the registration window closes (approximately from ages -6 months to 18 months for the child)\n• Treatment Group 2: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for one year, starting immediately after the registration window closes (approximately from ages -6 months to 6 months for the child)\n• Treatment Group 3: Pregnant women from 240 AWCs will receive a monthly Rs. 500 cash transfer for one year, starting one year after the registration window closes (approximately from ages 6 months to 18 months for the child)\n• Control group: 240 AWCs will serve as the control group for the three treatments\n In the treatment arms, the cash transfers will be framed as to be used for maternal and child nutrition. This message will be reinforced by regular interactive voice response phone calls to beneficiaries. Control households will receive similar phone calls, but with a generic message encouraging spending on nutrition, to keep the role of messaging constant between the groups. Since households will be randomly assigned to these groups, we can compare between them to determine the relative effectiveness of getting transfers at different ages for child nutrition. The results will speak to broader questions around targeting cash transfers to mothers of young children, and the rate of return to expanding the fiscal envelope to increase spending on early childhood nutrition.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nChild height and weight for age at age 2\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

An Experiment in Changing Dispute Resolution Behavior through Community Education\nRCT_ID: AEARCTR-0001038\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.1038-1.0\n\nINTERVENTION_TEXT:\nThis study looks at the effectiveness of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) education as a peacebuilding tool. ADR is a set of informal practices and norms of negotiation and mediation that are intended to help parties reach self-enforcing bargains faster than courts can. The study was conducted in Liberia where rule of law is weak and property disputes are endemic and often escalate to violence. A total of 86 communities were given 8 days of ADR education and subsequent dispute outcomes within those communities were surveyed within the next few months.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe government of Liberia nominated 246 communities in the counties of Lofa, Nimba and Grand Gedeh for ADR education. Out of these communities 116 were randomly chosen for treatment, the ADR education workshop, to be rolled out in five phases. Treatment communities were randomly assigned to the phases. Due to resource constraints, the training was completed in 86 communities instead of 116 leaving 160 as control.\nIn each treatment community, 15% of the adult population participated in the training which was conducted over 8 days by two facilitators over a period of two months. Groups of 35 participants were educated in each workshop. However, 16 of the 86 communities were subject to intense treatment whereby 25% of the population participated in the training to understand the marginal effect of increased training. The selection of these populations was not random rather were by choice of village leaders. \nEndline surveys begun approximately ten months after the first workshop and were conducted on a rolling basis even as treatment workshops were being rolled in many communities. Thus in some communities the endline survey was concurrent with treatment. Although this was unintentional, this allowed the researchers to understand the impact of the ADR education program over a timeline of zero months to almost two years.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nOutcome variables measure impact on:, (i) land disputes, (ii) women and minorities, (iii) property ownership and security, (iv) interpersonal disputes, (v) community level disputes, (vi) Whether difficult conflicts are resolved\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The control contract will offer to purchase a given amount of the rice harvest at a given price. The two treatment arms offer technical training (T1) or inputs (T2), in combination with a guarantee to purchase a given amount of the rice harvest at a given price, less the costs of the training and/or inputs.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWorking with a local NGO that is already engaged in contract rice farming, we have developed three types of contracts designed to uncovered what are the binding constraints to rice production in Benin. In the first contract, the control, the NGO offers a guarantee to purchase a given amount of the rice harvest of a farmer at a given price. Comparing levels of rice production under this contract with rice production data collected in the baseline, we can determine the impact on investment and production of providing a guaranteed output market. In the second contract, treatment 1, the NGO offers to provide skills training and technical backstopping in exchange for purchasing a given amount of the rice harvest of a farmer at a given price. Comparing levels of rice production under this contract with baseline production and production in the control group, we can determine the impact on investment and production of moving farmers closer to the production possibilities frontier. In the third contract, treatment 2, the NGO offers to provide inputs, on loan, in exchange for purchasing a given amount of the rice harvest of a farmer at a given price. Comparing levels of rice production under this contract with baseline production and production in the control group, we can determine the impact on investment and production of easing farmers' credit constraints.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nOur primary analysis will test the difference in rice production under the three randomized states. We will also look at heterogeneity of take-up by each of the following covariates., Rate of inter-temporal substitution of income and time inconsistency of this rate., Wealth (land ownership, number of livestock, quality of housing stock), Index of experience and satisfaction with contract farming prior to the experiment, Historical production levels, Household characteristics (gender of head of household, education level, experience with rice farming, household size), If any of these variables presents a particularly skewed distribution, we will report the heterogeneity by the trimmed variable or by deciles.

The aim of this program is to increase the well-being of these families. The program was started 19 years ago in Chile and now works in 19 Latin American countries. This NGO has built almost 100,000 houses with the help of an army of volunteers. Every year, more than 30,000 youths throughout Latin America volunteer to work with TECHO. We evaluate the program in three Latin American countries: El Salvador, Uruguay, and Mexico. \n TECHO targets the poorest informal settlements and, within these settlements, households that are lodged in very substandard dwellings. TECHO serves \"irregular settlements,\" which are de\ffined as communities in which a majority of the families are living on plots of land that they do not own. These settlements are plagued by a host of problems, including insufficient access to basic utilities (water, electricity and sanitation), signifi\fcant levels of soil and water contamination, and overcrowding. The typical housing units in these informal settlements are no better than the surrounding dwellings, as they are rudimentary units constructed from discarded materials such as cardboard, tin and plastic, have dirt floors and lack connections to basic utilities such as water supply and sewerage systems. \n The TECHO housing units are 18 square meters (6m by 3m) in size. The walls are made of pre-fabricated, insulated pinewood or aluminum panels, and the roofs are made of tin to keep occupants warm and protect them from humidity, insects, and rain. Floors are built on top of 15 stacks that raise them up to between 30 and 80 centimeters of the ground in order to reduce dampness and protect occupants from floods and infestations. Although these houses are a major improvement over the recipients' previous dwellings, the amenities that they offer are limited, as they do not include a bathroom or kitchen or plumbing, drinking water hook-ups or gas connections. The houses are designed to be low in cost and easy to construct; they can be placed on a plot of land next to an existing house or as a new unit\nthat replaces the existing one. Units are modular and portable, can be built with simple tools, and are set up by volunteers working in squads of from 4 to 8 members. The cost of a TECHO house is less than US$1,000 -- with the bulk of the cost being accounted for by the acquisition, storage and transportation of the building materials, since there are essentially no labor costs. The bene\fficiary family contributes 10% of that amount (around US$100). In El Salvador, US$100 is approximately equivalent to 3.3 months' per capita baseline earnings, while in Mexico and Uruguay, it is roughly equivalent to 1.6 and 1.4 months, respectively. Importantly, added to the fact that the TECHO house is heavily subsidized, there are no exact substitutes of TECHO houses on the market that households could be investing in incrementally. TECHO do not offer the house in the market and only offer it to a group of selected slum dwellers that are in the poorest conditions within slums. Hence, even if households did not face credit constrains to get access to housing improvements, they could not get access to TECHO houses neither in the form nor at the price offered by TECHO. This consideration is relevant for interpreting the results of our study. Finally, the houses are also easy to disassemble and move to a new location. It is important for the houses to be movable because most of the families in these makeshift settlements do not have formal title to the land that they live on. TECHO managers were concerned that upgrading the value of the land by building permanent housing might induce both public and private owners to try to force residents to move in order to reclaim the improved land. However, making the housing mobile does away with that incentive.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nExperimental design\n Between 2007 and 2010, TECHO implemented the program in a number of selected slums in each country. TECHO budget constraints limit the number of housing units that can be built at any one time. Under these constraints, TECHO opted to select beneficiaries by means of a lottery system that gives all eligible households within a settlement an equal opportunity to receive one of the units. TECHO first selected a set of eligible settlements and asked their volunteers to conduct a census to identify eligible households within each settlement, those with extremely poor housing conditions. The eligible households were then surveyed (baseline survey) and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups within each settlement. In general, the number of treatments represents a small portion of all the households in the settlement. For example, in around 40% of the settlements, less than 10% of the households were treated, and the proportion of treated households exceeded 50% of the slum population in only 8% of the settlements.\n In order to obtain accurate information from the households and to avoid creating any desirability bias in the treatment group, the data collection work was separated from the implementation of the intervention by contracting a highly respected survey firm in each country. The enumerators told the interviewees that they were collecting data for a study on living conditions\nand did not make any reference to TECHO verbally or in writing. After randomization, treatment households were told about the program and its requirements by TECHO offcials. Some of them agreed to participate in the program and some did not. Control households were explicitly not told that\nthey would receive the benefits provided by the program in the future, so their behavior should not have been affected by the expectation of being treated in the next round, although they may have felt frustrated when they realized that\nthey had lost the lottery. \n Since TECHO did not have the capacity to work in all settlements at the same time, the program was rolled out in each country in two phases at the settlement level. Baseline surveys were conducted approximately one month before the start of the construction work in each settlement, which gave\nhouseholds time to acquire the funds to make the 10% contribution required by the program, while the follow-up surveys were conducted simultaneously for\nall settlements for both phases in each country. \n While the settlements were not randomly allocated to phases, there is plausibly exogenous variation in the amount of time that beneficiaries had occupied the house at the time of the follow-up survey, since no discretionary criteria were used to select which slum went to which phase. Instead, the decision as to which slum would be treated first and which would be treated\nlater on depended on the inflow of census information about eligible households for each slum. When the information on the set of eligible households in each slum was delivered to the central office, TECHO organized its internal resources in such a way as to treat the assigned-to-treatment households in that slum as soon as possible. This suggests that the allocation of slums to phases depended more on the capacity of the volunteers assigned to each slum to conduct the census of eligible households than on the characteristics of the slum dwellers in that location. Phase I settlements had 24 months of exposure, on average, while Phase II settlements had an average of 16 months of exposure, for a difference of 8 months, on average. \n Our sample includes a total of 74 settlements, of which 29 were in Phase I and 45 were in Phase II. The total number of eligible households in these settlements was 2373. Treatment was offered to 57% of the households, and over 85% of those households actually received a new house. The remaining 15%\nthat were assigned to treatment could not afford the required 10% co-payment balanced across phases. Attrition rates between baseline and follow-up amounted to 6% of the\nhouseholds in the assigned-to-treatment group and 7% of those in the control group, with most of the attriters being households whose members moved out of the slum and could not be reached in their new location. This difference is not statistically significant at conventional levels. The difference between\nthe attrition rates of the assigned-to-treatment and control groups within each phase was not statistically significant either. Finally, the attrition rates are also balanced across phases.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nSatisfaction with quality of life, Standardized satisfaction with quality of life, Satisfaction with quality of housing conditions, Standardized Satisfaction with quality of housing conditions\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Half of the tours will be control visits unrelated to themes of migration and hospitality: control subjects will visit the museum's isle dedicated to Fonte Gaia. The other half of the tour will focus on the frescoes in the Pilgrimage Hall of the museum. Such tours will focus on the previous role of the museum as a hospital helping people in need. This tour is designed to subtly highlight themes of hospitality and historical migration.\n The tour will be performed by employees of the museum who are professional guides. They prepared the itinerary of both visits and they have been instructed to be neutral in the exposition during the tours. It is key that the connection between the themes of the visit in the treated group and immigration arise naturally in the minds of the students, without nudging from the guide.\n After the visit, subjects will answer a final questionnaire. At the same time, we will ask subjects if they want to donate a fraction of the show-up fee. This is going to be the primary outcome we will measure to asses the impact of the treatment.

The farmer had to decide during the visit whether or not to participate in the program, and could buy any amount of fertilizer. In the second season, a new group of farmers was selected to receive the basic SAFI treatment. The second season also included additional interventions, structured as follows:\n SAFI with ex ante choice of timing: A field officer visited the farmers before the harvest and offered them the opportunity to decide when, during the next growing season, they wanted the officer to return to offer them the SAFI program. They were then visited at the specified time, and offered a chance to buy a voucher for future fertilizer use (as in the Basic SAFI program, as described above).\n Free delivery visit later in the season: Same as the basic SAFI intervention, but farmers were visited later in the season. A field officer visited farmers 2-4 months after the harvest (when it is time to apply fertilizer as a top-dressing to the next crop), and offered them the opportunity to buy fertilizer, at the regular price, with free delivery. \n Subsidy later in season: A field officer visited the farmers 2-4 months after the harvest (when it is time to apply fertilizer to the next crop) and offered to sell them fertilizer, at a 50 percent subsidy, with free delivery.\n In each of the intervention groups, as well as in the comparison group, a random subset of farmers was offered the option to sell a set quantity of maize at a favorable price to the field officer before the program took place.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nIn collaboration with the NGO International Child Support (ICS), researchers designed an intervention to test if providing mechanisms to save harvest income for future fertilizer purchase could be effective in increasing usage. The intervention was called the Savings and Fertilizer Initiative (SAFI). The design of the experiment allowed researchers to test the impact of the SAFI program against various other strategies to improve usage, in particular fertilizer subsidies. The project also investigates whether difficulty in saving harvest income until the time that inputs are needed is a significant barrier to adoption. Finally, the option given to farmers to sell maize before the program took place tests the alternative hypothesis that the SAFI program was seen by the farmers just as a safer way to protect their savings than available alternatives.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nFertilizer use (by season)\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

We took advantage of this plan by randomly dividing Rwanda’s 30 districts to either phase I or phase II. To do so, districts within each province were first matched in pairs or groups of three to ensure the best possible match between the two district groups. The districts were matched on the following five district characteristics:\n • Population change between 2002 and 2006\n• Population density\n• Common Development Fund (CDF) appropriation amounts for FY 2008 (as a proxy for poverty levels)\n• Share of district spending obtained through local revenues in FY 2008\n• District expenditure per capita on good governance and social affairs \n These matched district pairs or triplets were then used as randomization blocks. Specifically, after these blocks were created a public lottery was conducted in the presence of district officials to randomly assign districts within each block to the treatment group (districts that would receive program activities in phase I in 2011), or the control group (districts that were to receive program activities in phase II in 2012). The 15 control districts never received any program activities because the RTP was not extended beyond 2011.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe baseline and follow-up surveys collected data on respondents’ civic participation levels, including awareness and perceptions of local government performance, responsiveness, and accountability. Specifically, respondents were asked about their awareness of local government meetings, familiarity with local government officials, perceived citizen influence, and knowledge and access to information about local government affairs. Respondents were also asked about their overall satisfaction with government services related to water infrastructure, local road conditions, waste collection, public schools, and health clinics.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Evidence from a field experiment in amateur football\nRCT_ID: AEARCTR-0008049\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.8049-1.1\n\nINTERVENTION_TEXT:\nA national football federation sends an email to coaches of amateur football clubs, pointing to the important role football plays in promoting inclusivity and reducing racism in society. The email also describes findings from earlier studies showing that discrimination is present in amateur football. Each amateur football club in the country is randomly assigned to either receiving the email or not. At most one coach per club is contacted.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nPrevious field experiments show that amateur soccer clubs discriminate against people with foreign-sounding names. We want to replicate parts of these experiments. In addition, our key aim is to detect if it is possible to decrease discrimination.\n We follow the method of previous research (e.g., Nesseler et al., (2019) or Gomez-Gonzalez et al., (2021)). Thus, we create fictitious amateur soccer players that are asking amateur soccer teams to participate in a trial session. We then evaluate the response of the soccer clubs. \n Following the recommendations of the ethical committee, we send another email to coaches who respond to the request to join a training. The email aims to minimize the impact on coaches and reads as follows: \"Thank you very much for your answer. Unfortunately, I am no longer interested.\"\n References\nGomez-Gonzalez, C., Nesseler, C., & Dietl, H. M. (2021). Mapping discrimination in Europe through a field experiment in amateur sport.

In the control group (the group of coaches who have not been sent an email by the federation), we expect a positive gap in positive response rates to emails signed with a native and foreign-sounding name. In the treatment group, we expect that this gap is smaller. A positive response is defined as either an invitation to come to a training or a conditional acceptance (e.g. yes, you're welcome, but only if you are a player of a particular type, e.g. defender).\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Sample women were given a voucher guaranteeing free and immediate access to modern contraceptives through a private appointment with a family planning nurse. This included access to the most concealable and highly demanded method, which is often out of stock—injectables. In one condition, the voucher was provided to women alone (“Individual”) and required her signature only; in the other condition it was handed to the husband in the presence of his wife and required both of their signatures (“Couple”).\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nSample women were recruited from the catchment area of Chipata Clinic, a large government clinic that serves low-income “compound” neighborhoods in Lusaka. Married women of childbearing age (18–40) were invited to participate in the study if they: (i) currently lived with their husband; (ii) had last given birth between January 2004 and December 2006; (iii) were not currently pregnant; (iv) had neither been sterilized nor had a hysterectomy; (v) were not known to have health conditions for which hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated; and (vi) agreed to participate in a survey and information session about family planning together with their husband. Although the voucher intervention only required the husband’s presence in the Couple condition, criteria (vi) was imposed on all subjects in order to prevent higher rates of attrition among those assigned to the Couple condition relative to those in the Individual condition. \n The experiment consisted of a baseline survey in the first visit administered solely to the wife, during which an appointment was made for a second visit with both the wife and husband. Individual versus Couple condition was then randomly assigned. During the second visit, husband and wife were surveyed separately. In the Individual condition, the wife was given the voucher in private and in the Couple condition, the voucher was given to the husband in presence of the wife.\n Two years later, researchers conducted a follow-up survey to study the impact of contraceptive access on fertility( birth rates 9–13 months after a respondent received the voucher) and well-being.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nContraceptive uptake through voucher use, Fertility, Well-being\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Evidence from India\nRCT_ID: AEARCTR-0002808\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.2808-1.1\n\nINTERVENTION_TEXT:\nThis paper examines the persistence of management practices adopted after an extensive consultant-supported intervention that we undertook in a set of multi-plant Indian textile weaving firms from 2008 to 2010 (Bloom et al, 2013). Firms were randomly allocated into treatment and control groups, and the intervention was done at the plant level within each firm. Both treatment and control plants were given recommendations for improving management practices in several areas, and the treatment plants received additional consulting assistance in implementing the recommendations. The intervention led to a substantial adoption of the recommended practices in the treatment plants and a modest one in the control plants, with corresponding improvements in various measures of performance.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nOur original experiment measured the impact of improving management practices in a set of large textile firms near Mumbai. This experiment involved 28 plants across 17 firms in the woven cotton fabric industry. Firms had been in operation for 20 years on average, and all were family-owned and managed. These firms are large, complex organizations, with a median of 2 plants per firm and 4 reporting levels (Table A1 reports baseline summary statistics). We contracted with a leading international management consultancy firm to work with the plants in order to change plant-level management practices rapidly. \nThe intervention ran from August 2008 until August 2010, with data collection continuing until November 2011. The intervention focused on a set of 38 management practices that are standard in American, European, and Japanese manufacturing firms and which can be grouped into five broad areas: factory operations, quality control, inventory control, human-resources management, and sales and orders management (for details see Appendix Table A2). Each practice was measured as a binary indicator of the adoption (1) or non-adoption (0) of the practice. \nThe consulting intervention had three phases. The diagnostic phase took one month and was given to all treatment and control experimental plants. It involved evaluating the current management practices of each plant, constructing a performance database, and providing each plant with a detailed analysis of its current management practices along with recommendations for change. The second phase was a four-month implementation phase given only to the treatment experimental plants. In this phase, the consulting firm followed up on the diagnostic report to help introduce as many of the 38 management practices as the plants could be persuaded to adopt. The third phase was a measurement phase, which lasted until November 2011, involving the collection of performance and management data from all treatment and control plants. \nSee Bloom et al.

We will vary (1) the conditionality of the incentives (“unconditional” and “conditional” incentives), (2) whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers (“patient outreach” and “patient provides names” conditions), and (3) whether the new suspects know who named them (“known referrer” and “anonymous referrer” conditions). \n The “unconditional” incentive will consist of Rupees (Rs.) 150 offered to current patients for each new suspect they induce to come to the center and get tested for TB. When the reward is fixed, each current patient has an incentive to refer any person who may be willing to be tested, irrespective of whether they know or believe they have TB. The “conditional” incentive treatment will consist of Rs. 100 for each new suspect who comes to the center and gets tested, plus a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB. Comparison of the effect of conditional and unconditional incentives will allow us to determine whether the subjects take advantage of incentives that do not depend on test results, and whether they have concrete information about their contacts’ health. \n To separate the effect of current patients’ networks from their ability to deliver information and persuade new suspects to get tested, we will vary whether outreach is led by patients or OpASHA’s health workers. In the “patient outreach” treatment, current patients will be given a set of referral cards and will be told that they will receive the reward if new suspects present at the center with the card and get tested for TB; in the “patient provides names” treatment, current patients will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they believe should get tested, and will receive the reward if the new suspect, who will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, comes to the center and gets tested. \n Finally, there will be two versions of the “patient provides names” treatment. In the “known referrer” version, the health workers will reveal to the new suspects who named them, whereas in the “anonymous referrer” version, the name of the referrer will not be revealed to the new suspects. This will allow us to determine the extent to which social stigma is a barrier to referrals. In fact, if social costs are the reason why current patients are reluctant to approach others, anonymity should remove them resulting in more and perhaps more effective referrals.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nAll of Opertaion ASHA's DOTs centers will be divided into one of the following 9 treatment conditions and a pure control group. All patients attending a given center who have been in treatment for at least two weeks, plus those who recently completed treatment, will be asked to participate in a TB detection scheme under one of the following 9 conditions: \n T0: Pure control group: No treatment whatsoever. Current patients will be simply surveyed at baseline. New patients will also be surveyed and asked whether current or previous Operation ASHA patient induced them to get tested and start treatment.\n T1: Encouragement to refer new suspects (“CP-gives-out-cards”): Each current patient at these centers will receive ten referral cards and will be invited to give the cards to five different people whom they think should be tested for TB. \n T2: Encouragement to provide names of new suspects (“CP-provides-names – referrer revealed”): Each current patient at these centers will be invited to provide names and contact information of people whom they think should be tested for TB. The patients will be told that these individuals will be approached by OpASHA’s health workers, and that their names will be mentioned to the new suspects.\n T3: Encouragement to provide names of new suspects (“CP-provides-names – referrer anonymous”): This is the same as T2, except that the current patient will be told that their name will NOT be mentioned to the new suspects. \n T4: CP-gives-out-cards + Unconditional Incentives: Current patients in these centers will be offered Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested for TB. \n T5: CP-provides-names/referrer revealed + Unconditional Incentive: Current patients in these centers will be told they will receive Rupees (Rs.) 150 for each new patient of those whose names they provided comes to the center and gets tested for TB.\n T6: CP-provides-names/referrer anonymous + Unconditional Incentive: This is the same as T5, except that the current patient will be told that their name will NOT be mentioned to the new suspects.\n T7: CP-gives-out-cards + Unconditional Incentive + Conditional Bonus: Current patients in these centers will be offered Rs. 100 for each new patient who brings one of their cards to the center and gets tested; in addition, they will receive a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB. \n T8: CP-provides-names/referrer revealed + Unconditional Incentive + Conditional Bonus: Current patients in these centers will be offered Rs. 100 for each new patient of those whose names they provided comes to the center and gets tested for TB; in addition, they will receive a Rs. 150 bonus if the new suspect tests positive for TB.\n T9: CP-provides-names/referrer anonymous + Unconditional Incentive + Conditional Bonus: This is the same as T8, except that the current patient will be told that their name will NOT be mentioned to the new suspects.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nBelow we explain how our experimental design will allow us to answer our primary research questions. This will also clarify the marginal contribution of each treatment arm.\n The experimental variation will allow us to test for the effectiveness of a variety of incentives, in order to identify the mechanisms through which barriers to referrals and treatment are alleviated. To measure the effects of our interventions, we will estimate versions (e.g., probit) of the following econometric model:\n yij= α + βE ecnourage + βR reward + βB bonus + βN names +βA anonym + γXi +Tt + εijt \n where i denotes the individual patients, j the randomly assigned treatment condition, and t the month of the intervention. yij represents the outcome variable of interest (e.g., yi = 1 if patient i made a referral, and 0 otherwise; or yi = 1 if patient i referred someone who tested positive for TB, and 0 otherwise). The key parameters of interest on the right-hand side of model (1) are the treatment effects βk, with the constant α representing, all else equal, the response in the pure control condition T0. First of all, the estimated coefficient βE will reveal whether encouragement to refer new suspects has an effect, even in the absence of incentives. In fact, an explicit appeal accompanied by referral cards might increase the salience of the request, thereby increasing referrals. Second, comparing βR and βE will determine whether financial rewards are effective at inducing current patients to find and refer new suspects (Q1). Third, comparing βB vs. βR will allow us to assess the extent to which unconditional incentives induce strategic behavior on the part of patients to refer individuals who are not sick only to obtain the reward (Q2a) and whether the current patients have concrete information on the health status of their social contacts (Q2b). Specifically, if patients in the unconditional incentive arm behave opportunistically by disproportionally referring people who are not sick, the number of referrals made will be higher and the share that test positive for TB smaller compared to those for patients in the bonus condition. Such a result will also indicate that patients do have information about the health condition of their social contacts (or an obtain it by exerting more effort). Fourth, comparison between βN and βE will reveal whether outreach by peers (current patients) or outreach by health workers is more effective in enrolling new suspects (Q3). Since current patients may also contact new suspects when they receive incentives based on intake of those new suspects, we can also estimate differences-in-differences specifications that include the interaction between eligibility for a reward, and outreach by peers vs. health workers. Finally, the estimated coefficient βA will inform us about the role of stigma and other “social costs” in making current patients reluctant to make referrals (Q4). For example, if we found that the share of referrals who are TB positive is higher when the referrer remains anonymous, that would indicate that stigma and related social costs are indeed a barrier that is making patients reluctant to approach others in their social circles who are likely also sick. Tt are month fixed effects, included to control for seasonality effects and other unobservable factors associated with the different intervention periods. Individual characteristics (including demographics such as age and gender, and other characteristics such as personality traits, experience with the disease and the clinic, etc.) will be reported in the vector of controls Xi. εijt is the error term. Because the randomization was done at the center level, we adjust the standard errors by allowing for clustering by center.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe key outcomes of interest in this experiment are:, 1. How many new patients enter treatment under each incentive scheme? Do financial incentives result in more new patients?, 2. Which is more effective in enrolling new suspects, outreach by peers (current patients) or outreach by health workers?, 3. What are the characteristics of new patients who enter treatment as a result of each treatment condition?, 4. Which incentive scheme is most effective in causing new patients to complete treatment?, 5. What is the role of stigma and other social cost in preventing current patients from referring new suspects? Do current patients refer more new suspects if they can remain anonymous?, 6. Do current patients behave strategically by bringing in false suspects as a result of financial incentives?, 7. Do new patients who have received financial incentives for entering treatment behave differently when seeking care for other illnesses in the future?, We will collect data through the following sources:, 1. Data recorded by Op ASHA's health counselors (including TB test results obtained from the DMCs), 2. Existing Patient surveys, 3. New Patient surveys, 4.

All eligible students were invited to apply to the program by completing an intake survey. Of the 1,271 eligible students who completed the survey, 400 first and second year students were randomly selected to participate—100 male and 100 female students in each year. The remaining students, who completed the survey but were not invited to participate in the OK program, served as a control group.\n OK program participants earned $100 for each class in which they attained a grade of 70 percent or better, and an additional $20 for each percentage point above 70 percent. Rewards were paid out at the end of every term. In addition, these students were randomly assigned and contacted by peer advisors—paid and trained upper-class students who provided advice about study strategies, time management, and university bureaucracy as well as information about OK scholarships. Advisors emailed advisees once every two to three weeks, whether or not the advisees responded. Program engagement was high; by year’s end, at least 86 percent of OK participants had checked their scholarship earnings on the OK website or emailed a peer advisor or program staff.\n Data for this study came primarily from university records containing information on applicants, enrolled students, and course grades. Researchers supplemented this with a baseline survey used to identify the population eligible for random assignment.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe “Opportunity Knocks” (OK) experiment was implemented on an Ontario commuter campus affiliated with a large public university in the fall of 2008. First and second-year students who applied for financial aid were offered the chance to participate in the program. Those who agreed were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Treated students earned $100 for each class in which they attained a grade of 70 or better and an additional $20 for each percentage point above 70 percent. Researchers focused on grades near 70 because anything worse is typically seen as unsatisfactory and because awards for lower levels of achievement are likely to be prohibitively expensive. A student with a full-course load scoring 75 in every course qualified for $2,000 over the course of the school year (10 * ($100 + (5 * 20))). Randomly assigned peer advisors, upper-class students who had been trained to provide advice about study strategies, time management, and university bureaucracy, also contacted participants. \n In late summer of 2008, researchers invited 1,056 first years and 1,073 second years to participate in OK. Eligible students are those who had requested financial aid, had an email address, had a high school GPA recorded in the university administrative information system, and had enrolled for at least 1.5 credits (half of a full load) in the fall semester. Invitees who completed the intake survey and gave consent were eligible for random assignment. Of the 1,271 students who completed the survey and were eligible, 400 were treated. Treatment assignment was stratified by year (first and second) and sex, with 100 in each group. Within sex-year cells, assignment was stratified by high school GPA quartile, with 25 in each group (the analysis controls for strata). \n In an effort to gauge subjects’ understanding of program award rules, researchers included in the OK intake survey two questions meant to gauge subjects’ understanding of program award rules. The first asked students to calculate the award amount for one class, and the second asked them to calculate the total award amount from five classes. Approximately two-thirds of the sample evaluated the example correctly. The services component of OK matched all treated students with (trained and paid) same-sex peer advisors. Peer advisors were enthusiastic upper-year students or recent graduates with good grades. Each peer advisor covered 50 participants. Advisors emailed advisees once every two to three weeks, offering advice on upcoming academic events and workshops and guidance relevant for key periods in the academic calendar, such as midterms and finals. Advisors also provided information about OK scholarships, including reminders of the scholarship calculation and payment schedules. Advisors invited their clients to turn to them for help with any academic or personal issues that seemed relevant to academic success.\n The data for this study come primarily from the university records containing information on applicants, enrolled students, and course grades. Researchers supplemented this with data from a baseline survey used to identify the population eligible for random assignment, as well as more descriptive focus-group style information collected from a few subjects after the experiment. \n Analysis compares the amount earned by the experimental group with the earnings that students in the control group would have been entitled to had they been in the program. A large program effect should be reflected in larger-than expected earnings, where expected earnings are measured using the grade distribution in the control sample. Estimates of earnings and other effects come from regressions, where the dependent variable is the outcome for a given student in a given stratum, controlling for strata effects, treatment assignment indicator, and additional controls (e.g., age, high school grade average, whether 1st language is English, mother is a college graduate, and father is a college graduate, correctly answered harder question on scholarship formula, controls who would have earned some scholarship money, hypothetical earnings for controls). Because treatment is randomly assigned, covariates are unnecessary to reduce omitted variables bias in the estimated treatment effects. Models with covariates may, however, generate more precise estimates.\n In addition to assessment of intention-to-treat effects, researchers also used two stage least squares (2SLS) to estimate the effect of treatment on participants. Some of those assigned to treatment did not really participate in the program. Researchers used the randomly assigned offer of OK treatment as an instrument for program take-up (any contact); by virtue of random assignment the OK offer is unrelated to characteristics of eligible students. Because no one in the control group participated, 2SLS estimates capture the effect of participation on program participants (Number of Courses with Grade of At Least 70 Percent, Total Grade Percentage Points Over 70 Percent, GPA, Average Grades, (Hypothetical) Program Earnings). Effects on program participants give a kind of theoretical upper bound on program effects for this particular intervention; these estimates tell us how much achievement was boosted for those who responded to incentives in some measurable way.\n Researchers look at treatment effects for the entire sample and for those who answered the second assessment question correctly to see if the effects of the OK scholarships depend on participants’ understanding of how the formula linking grades and awards works.\n To assess students’ perception of the experiment-induced motivation, the OK sign-up survey asked students to predict their average grades in two scenarios: as an OK participant and as a non-participant. To encourage a thoughtful response, researchers offered to win a $500 prize to be given to the student whose predictions came closest to the mark. After the program ended, researchers asked students who predicted no effect in the intake survey why they had expected this. This generated very low response rate. Researchers also surveyed a random sample of 50 students from the treatment group at the end of the school year (May 13, 2009), offering $25 movie gift certificates to those who responded to tell whether and how the scholarship motivated them. Researchers also assessed self-reported usefulness of peer advisor e-mails.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nNumber of Courses with Grade of At Least 70 Percent, Total Grade Percentage Points Over 70 Percent, GPA, Average Grades, (Hypothetical) Program Earnings\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

In each identified community, staff members then facilitated a Participatory Wealth Ranking (PWR), in which members of the community worked together to rank households by economic status. Finally, staff members returned for a verification of the households judged to be the poorest. The program was implemented by Presbyterian Agricultural Services, a local nongovernmental organization, in coordination with Innovations for Poverty Action, a non-profit research organization. \n The basic GUP program involved the transfer of a productive asset; skills training for the management of the asset as well as life skills training, a weekly cash stipend for consumption support, worth between $6 and $9 PPP depending on family size, lasting for 3-10 months; access to a savings account at a local bank (details below in the experimental design section, as this is one of the components unpacked); and some basic health services and health education. The productive asset was provided at the beginning of the program, and households were permitted to choose a package of assets from a set list. The rest of these services were delivered over two years via regular visits (typically weekly) by a field officer from the implementing organization.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe program included several experimental arms designed to unpack whether specific components were sufficient on their own. First, we introduced variation in the core program at the household level: 50% of sample households within GUP villages were randomly assigned to the graduation program without savings (\"GUP without savings\"), and 50% received the standard program with collection of\nsavings for deposit into a local bank by the field agent (\"GUP with savings\").\n Second, we introduced two additional treatment groups at the village-level. For each of these two additional treatment groups, a two-level design was maintained, thus creating treatment households in treatment villages, control households in treatment villages, and control households in control villages. \n In Asset-Only villages, 50% of sample households were assigned to treatment, and received only a productive asset, without skills training on how to use it, or any of the other GUP components. These households were simply given four goats, since this was the most popular asset in GUP (71% of households chose a package of assets that included four goats). Goats were chosen because most households have had or have some goats, and thus would typically be content with receiving more, and we did not want to interact with the households and give them choices for fear that such engagement itself could change behavior.\n In Saving Out of Ultra Poverty (\"SOUP\") villages, 59% of sample households were assigned to the SOUP treatment, and received a visit from the field agent to collect savings, just as in the GUP with savings group, but did not receive any other components of the program. Of this 59%, half received savings accounts and deposit collection without a match (“SOUP without match”) and half received savings accounts and deposit collection with a 50% match (\"SOUP with match\"). Specifically, for every GHC 1 deposited, households in this group received a matching contribution of GHC 0.50. The remaining households in SOUP villages were assigned to the SOUP control group.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nasset value index, consumption index, financial inclusion index, food security index, income index\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nbusiness income, crop income, animal revenue, wage income, savings deposits, livestock value (goat, fowl, pig, sheep, cow)\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Farmer loan groups in Malawi were offered credit to grow paprika. After the baseline survey was administered to individual farmers a training session was held for on the importance of credit history in ensuring future access to credit. Then, in treatment groups only, fingerprints were collected as part of the loan application and an explanation was given that this would be used to determine their identity on any future loan applications. Following this, loan applications were processed in the usual way without the status of fingerprinting being taken into account as a factor for loan approval.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe loans were provided by the Malawi Rural Finance Corporation (MRFC) to farmers for purchasing \"starter kits\" from Cheetah Paprika Limited (CP). CP is a privately owned agri‐business company that offers extension services and inputs at subsidized rates in exchange for farmers' commitment to sell the paprika crop to CP at harvest time. \n Farmers were asked to form groups of 15-20 members in order to apply for the loan, even though loans were given to individuals. The study sample consisted of 214 clubs with 3,206 farmers with half randomly allocated to treatment and the rest forming the control group. In treatment clubs only, fingerprints were collected as part of the loan application. A total of 1,147 applicants took out the loan. \nAn endline survey was administered after the harvested crops were sold to CP, but with 520 farmers. Due to budget constraints it was not possible to visit every participant rather, study participants were invited to come to a central location to be administered the follow-up interview.

Random assignment determined whether contact was initiated\nby a gay or straight canvasser and whether the canvasser discussed the subject of same-sex\nmarriage or recycling. Outcomes were assessed unobtrusively by online surveys conducted days,\nweeks, and months afterward. Canvassers were coached to be polite and respectful at all times, to listen attentively\nto voters when discussing either same-sex marriage or recycling, and to refrain from arguing with\nvoters. The\nsame-sex marriage script invited voters to share their experiences with marriage. This script was the\nsame for gay and straight canvassers, with one important exception. After establishing rapport with\nthe voter, midway through the conversation, gay canvassers revealed that they are gay or lesbian and\nthat they would like to get married but that the law prohibits same-sex marriage. Straight canvassers\ninstead described how their child, friend, or relative would like to get married but that the law prohibits\nsame-sex marriage. Voters were asked to share their thoughts on this dilemma. These doorstep\nconversations lasted on average 22 minutes.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nRegistered voters who had previously been enrolled in an Internet panel survey were\ncontacted at their doorstep by canvassers.

Outcomes were assessed unobtrusively by online surveys conducted days,\nweeks, and months afterward.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nBefore canvassers went into the field, the study first gathered baseline, positions on a range of political attitudes for all participants using an ostensibly unrelated online, survey. The survey included 50 questions, as described in the Supplemental Online Materials (SOM)., The two questions concerning same-sex marriage and feelings about gay people were buried amid, a large number of items on unrelated topics so that respondents would not suspect any connection, between the survey and the canvassing visit. The panel survey included the two outcome measures in, every wave, but the overall content of the survey was kept fresh by randomly rotating new questions, in each wave. Another important feature of the design concerns blinding of canvassers and survey, respondents. Voters were unaware that the online survey was related to the canvassing effort, and, canvassers had no knowledge that voters were participants in an online survey. Finally, to prevent, housemates from completing each other’s surveys, extensive precautions were taken, including issuing distinct personal login instructions to take differently named surveys, tracking of distinct IP addresses, and session cookies, and sending invitations to take the survey during working hours (91% were in, fact completed at work), when housemates would be less likely to be together.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}
