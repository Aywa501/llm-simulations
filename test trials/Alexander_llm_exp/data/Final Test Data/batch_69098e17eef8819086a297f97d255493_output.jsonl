End of the game: the group has largely moved to B and I chose B from round 61 onward because B had the higher expected payoff after A\u2019s drop.\n\nSummary thought (across rounds): In the first 60 rounds A was both the majority choice and the higher-expected-value option, so I followed A. After round 60 the payout probabilities changed (A dropped), making B the better option; I switched to B immediately based on the payoff change even when the group was still slow to follow.

Round 61: I notice the environment changed: A now has 50% success and B still 60%. I see about 30% of participants choosing B (so ~70% still choose A). I switch to B because B\u2019s EV = 3 while A\u2019s EV = 2; despite being in the minority, B is the better expected-value choice now.\n\n62. Round 62: I observe roughly 31% choosing B (69% A). I keep choosing B \u2014 the payoff change is objective, so following expected value makes sense even if the group hasn\u2019t caught up.\n\n63. Round 63: I see about 32% B (68% A).

I continue choosing B; I can see others slowly shifting.\n\n73. Round 73: Group ~41% B (59% A). I pick B \u2014 the group\u2019s behavior is moving toward the better option.\n\n74. Round 74: Group ~42% B (58% A). I choose B.\n\n75. Round 75: Group ~43% B (57% A). I keep choosing B for higher EV.\n\n76. Round 76: Group ~43% B (57% A). I still pick B.\n\n77.

Round 82: Group ~49% B (51% A). I choose B \u2014 almost even now, but I already switched earlier on EV grounds.\n\n83. Round 83: Group ~50% B (50% A). I pick B; ties in group split don\u2019t change my EV calculation \u2014 B is superior.\n\n84. Round 84: Group ~51% B (49% A). I continue with B \u2014 most people are now choosing B.\n\n85. Round 85: Group ~52% B (48% A). I pick B.\n\n86. Round 86: Group ~52% B (48% A). I choose B again.\n\n87. Round 87: Group ~53% B (47% A). I stick with B.\n\n88. Round 88: Group ~54% B (46% A). I pick B.\n\n89. Round 89: Group ~55% B (45% A). I choose B.\n\n90. Round 90: Group ~56% B (44% A). I continue with B \u2014 the group\u2019s shift confirms the advantage.\n\n91. Round 91: Group ~57% B (43% A). I pick B.\n\n92. Round 92: Group ~58% B (42% A). I choose B.\n\n93. Round 93: Group ~59% B (41% A). I stick with B.\n\n94. Round 94: Group ~60% B (40% A).

Round 98: Group ~63% B (37% A). I choose B.\n\n99. Round 99: Group ~64% B (36% A). I stick with B.\n\n100. Round 100: Group ~65% B (35% A). I choose B \u2014 by the end the group has mostly shifted to B, which I\u2019ve been choosing since the payoff change at round 61 because B has the higher expected value (EV = 3 vs A\u2019s EV = 2).\n\nSummary reflection: For rounds 1\u201360 A was both the majority choice and the better option (90% success). At round 61 the true success rate of A fell to 50%, making B (60%) the better option; I switched to B immediately and continued choosing it despite a lag in the group\u2019s behavior.

Reason: even split among others, but B\u2019s probability is higher so I stick with B.\n\nRound 84 \u2014 Observed: ~49% A / ~51% B. I choose B. Outcome: success (+7). Cumulative: 528. Reason: majority is now slightly on B and that matches the better payoff.\n\nRound 85 \u2014 Observed: ~48% A / ~52% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 525. Reason: occasional failures happen with B; still the rational choice.\n\nRound 86 \u2014 Observed: ~48% A / ~52% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 522. Reason: short-term noise doesn\u2019t overturn B\u2019s higher EV.\n\nRound 87 \u2014 Observed: ~47% A / ~53% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 519. Reason: stick with long-term expected payoff.\n\nRound 88 \u2014 Observed: ~46% A / ~54% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 516. Reason: random streaks happen; EV still favors B.\n\nRound 89 \u2014 Observed: ~45% A / ~55% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 513. Reason: short run of bad luck; continue with B.\n\nRound 90 \u2014 Observed: ~44% A / ~56% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 510. Reason: expected-value decision remains unchanged.\n\nRound 91 \u2014 Observed: ~43% A / ~57% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 507. Reason: sticking to the statistically better option.\n\nRound 92 \u2014 Observed: ~42% A / ~58% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 504. Reason: longer-term averages matter more than a streak.\n\nRound 93 \u2014 Observed: ~41% A / ~59% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 501. Reason: remain with the higher EV despite variance.\n\nRound 94 \u2014 Observed: ~40% A / ~60% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 498. Reason: B is still better on average.\n\nRound 95 \u2014 Observed: ~39% A / ~61% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 495. Reason: occasional losing streaks don\u2019t change the EV ranking.\n\nRound 96 \u2014 Observed: ~39% A / ~61% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 492. Reason: stick with the statistically superior option.\n\nRound 97 \u2014 Observed: ~38% A / ~62% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 489. Reason: persistent short-term losses, but B\u2019s expected return is still higher.\n\nRound 98 \u2014 Observed: ~37% A / ~63% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 486. Reason: maintain strategy based on expected values.\n\nRound 99 \u2014 Observed: ~36% A / ~64% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Cumulative: 483. Reason: the run of failures is unfortunate; stick with B because it\u2019s still better in expectation.\n\nRound 100 \u2014 Observed: ~35% A / ~65% B. I choose B. Outcome: failure (-3). Final cumulative: 480. Reason: by the end most others had shifted to B and B had been the objectively better choice since round 61; despite late bad luck, following expected value produced the highest expected total.\n\nSummary thought: I followed the clear expected-value rule \u2014 choose A in rounds 1\u201360 (90% vs 60%) and switch to B in rounds 61\u2013100 when A dropped to 50%. I also noted the social signal: others mostly chose A early (which matched A\u2019s higher payoff) and gradually shifted toward B after the change; I switched promptly at round 61 because the payoff structure changed, not merely because others changed. The final score (480) reflects following the higher expected payoff each phase, with short-term variance (some losing streaks) along the way.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 7904, "total_tokens": 8065, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3456, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Round 60 \u2014 Others: A 80% / B 20%. I choose A. Summary through round 60: A\u2019s 90% success gives a much higher expected payoff (6 vs 3), and the group overwhelmingly choosing A reinforces that choice.\n\n61. Round 61 \u2014 Others: A 70.0% / B 30.0%. I choose B. The environment changed: A is now 50% (EV = 2) while B remains 60% (EV = 3).

At this point the group is nearly split; my EV-based choice aligns with the growing minority becoming the majority.\n\n82. Round 82 \u2014 Others: A 51.2% / B 48.8%. I choose B.\n\n83. Round 83 \u2014 Others: A 50.3% / B 49.7%. I choose B. The group is essentially even; my choice remains anchored to higher expected payoff.\n\n84. Round 84 \u2014 Others: A 49.4% / B 50.6%. I choose B. Now the group majority has flipped to B, which matches my EV-based decision.\n\n85. Round 85 \u2014 Others: A 48.5% / B 51.5%. I choose B.\n\n86.

Final summary: I followed A for rounds 1\u201360 because A had a clear expected-value advantage (90% success).

The group now has about 30.0% choosing B (70.0% A). Even though most still pick A, the payoff math has changed (B has higher expected return now), so I switch to B.\n\n62. Round 62 \u2014 Group roughly 30.9% B / 69.1% A. The social trend toward B is small but growing; since B's expected payoff is higher now, I continue choosing B.\n\n63.

Round 68 \u2014 ~36.3% B / 63.7% A. I pick B; both payoff and increasing group support recommend it.\n\n69. Round 69 \u2014 ~37.2% B / 62.8% A. I stay with B; social info and math agree.\n\n70. Round 70 \u2014 ~38.1% B / 61.9% A. I continue choosing B; the switch was warranted.\n\n71. Round 71 \u2014 ~39.0% B / 61.0% A.

I choose B; the trend reinforces my switch.\n\n74. Round 74 \u2014 ~41.7% B / 58.3% A. I continue with B \u2014 it's the better expected-return option.\n\n75. Round 75 \u2014 ~42.6% B / 57.4% A. I pick B; social momentum is building toward the superior button.\n\n76. Round 76 \u2014 ~43.5% B / 56.5% A. I stay with B; the payoff advantage is still the deciding factor.\n\n77. Round 77 \u2014 ~44.4% B / 55.6% A. I choose B again; group choice and EV align increasingly.\n\n78. Round 78 \u2014 ~45.3% B / 54.7% A. I continue selecting B; more people are following the better option.\n\n79. Round 79 \u2014 ~46.2% B / 53.8% A. I pick B; the majority isn't there yet, but B is already better.\n\n80. Round 80 \u2014 ~47.1% B / 52.9% A. Nearly half choose B now; I remain with B.\n\n81. Round 81 \u2014 ~47.9% B / 52.1% A. The fraction choosing B is approaching parity; I keep choosing B.\n\n82. Round 82 \u2014 ~48.8% B / 51.2% A. I stick with B; social info and EV are converging.\n\n83. Round 83 \u2014 ~49.7% B / 50.3% A. Roughly even now; I continue with B because it has higher expected return.\n\n84. Round 84 \u2014 ~50.6% B / 49.4% A. A tipping point: slightly more people pick B. I choose B and feel validated by both expected value and group movement.\n\n85. Round 85 \u2014 ~51.5% B / 48.5% A. The majority now favors B; I keep choosing B.\n\n86. Round 86 \u2014 ~52.4% B / 47.6% A. I remain with B; both payoff and social info support it.\n\n87. Round 87 \u2014 ~53.3% B / 46.7% A. I choose B; the group shift is clear and consistent with the changed environment.\n\n88. Round 88 \u2014 ~54.2% B / 45.8% A. I continue picking B; it's the better choice now.\n\n89. Round 89 \u2014 ~55.1% B / 44.9% A. I stick with B; social consensus and math agree.\n\n90. Round 90 \u2014 ~56.0% B / 44.0% A. I choose B; the group's choosing B by a good margin now.\n\n91. Round 91 \u2014 ~56.9% B / 43.1% A. I keep selecting B; the environment has clearly shifted.\n\n92. Round 92 \u2014 ~57.8% B / 42.2% A. I remain with B; it's the rational pick at this stage.\n\n93. Round 93 \u2014 ~58.7% B / 41.3% A. I choose B again; both payoff and peer choices favor it.\n\n94. Round 94 \u2014 ~59.6% B / 40.4% A. I stick with B; large fraction of others also doing so.\n\n95. Round 95 \u2014 ~60.5% B / 39.5% A. I keep choosing B; social reinforcement is strong.\n\n96. Round 96 \u2014 ~61.4% B / 38.6% A. I continue with B; the group has largely migrated.\n\n97. Round 97 \u2014 ~62.3% B / 37.7% A. I choose B; the shift is complete in practice.\n\n98. Round 98 \u2014 ~63.2% B / 36.8% A. I remain with B; everything points to B now.\n\n99.

End point: a clear majority chooses B and B has the higher expected payoff, so I choose B.\n\nSummary of my strategy: For rounds 1\u201360 I consistently picked A because it had a 90% success rate and the group (80% A) confirmed that choice. When the environment changed at round 61 (A dropped to 50%, B stayed 60%), I switched to B immediately and continued choosing B for rounds 61\u2013100; over those rounds the group gradually shifted toward B (30% \u2192 65%), which reinforced my decision.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 5801, "total_tokens": 5962, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2944, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

At round 61 the underlying success rates changed (A down to 50%), so B became the higher-EV option; I switched to B immediately and observed the group gradually follow from 30% B up to 65% B by round 100, which validated the choice over time.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 5046, "total_tokens": 5207, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1984, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

At the regime change (round 61) A\u2019s success dropped to 50% while B stayed at 60%, so I switched immediately to B and kept following B as the group gradually moved in the same direction.

I choose B \u2014 by this point B is both the group majority and the higher expected-value option (60% success vs A\u2019s 50%).\n\nSummary of my strategy: For rounds 1\u201360 I chose A every round because A\u2019s 90% success rate made it clearly superior (EV 6 vs 3) and the group overwhelmingly picked A. At the structural change starting round 61, A\u2019s success probability dropped to 50% while B stayed at 60%, so I switched immediately to B and stayed with B for rounds 61\u2013100. Throughout I paid attention to the group\u2019s choices as corroborating evidence: early on the majority reinforced sticking with A, and later the gradual shift toward B matched the change in which option had the higher expected payoff.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 6469, "total_tokens": 6630, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3712, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Reason: The group is now more mixed; B\u2019s higher EV keeps me on B.\n\n73. Round 73 \u2014 Observed: 59% A, 41% B. I choose B. Reason: Increasing social support for B is reassuring.\n\n74. Round 74 \u2014 Observed: 58% A, 42% B. I choose B. Reason: B\u2019s advantage is consistent; I keep choosing it.\n\n75. Round 75 \u2014 Observed: 57% A, 43% B. I choose B. Reason: The majority hasn\u2019t fully flipped yet, but the incentives have \u2014 so do I.\n\n76. Round 76 \u2014 Observed: 57% A, 43% B. I choose B. Reason: Slight rounding aside, B continues to climb; I stay with it.\n\n77. Round 77 \u2014 Observed: 56% A, 44% B. I choose B. Reason: Social information catches up gradually; my choice was already justified by EV.\n\n78. Round 78 \u2014 Observed: 55% A, 45% B. I choose B. Reason: Nearing parity; I remain with B.\n\n79. Round 79 \u2014 Observed: 54% A, 46% B. I choose B. Reason: My earlier switch continues to be sensible.\n\n80. Round 80 \u2014 Observed: 53% A, 47% B. I choose B. Reason: The group is almost even; B\u2019s EV advantage is my main consideration.\n\n81. Round 81 \u2014 Observed: 52% A, 48% B. I choose B. Reason: Social signals are now nearly balanced; expected payoff keeps me on B.\n\n82. Round 82 \u2014 Observed: 51% A, 49% B. I choose B. Reason: Very mixed group, but B is still the rational pick.\n\n83. Round 83 \u2014 Observed: 50% A, 50% B. I choose B. Reason: With the group evenly split and A worse in the new environment, B is the safer expected-return choice.\n\n84. Round 84 \u2014 Observed: 49% A, 51% B. I choose B. Reason: B has become the slight majority and has higher EV \u2014 validation for switching.\n\n85. Round 85 \u2014 Observed: 48% A, 52% B. I choose B. Reason: The social trend now aligns with the payoff advantage of B.\n\n86. Round 86 \u2014 Observed: 48% A, 52% B. I choose B. Reason: Continued drift toward B; I stay consistent.\n\n87. Round 87 \u2014 Observed: 47% A, 53% B. I choose B. Reason: Majority picks B and EV favors B \u2014 a comfortable match.\n\n88. Round 88 \u2014 Observed: 46% A, 54% B. I choose B. Reason: The majority has clearly moved; I\u2019m reaffirmed in choosing B.\n\n89. Round 89 \u2014 Observed: 45% A, 55% B. I choose B. Reason: Social proof and EV both point to B now.\n\n90. Round 90 \u2014 Observed: 44% A, 56% B. I choose B. Reason: The shift is decisive; B is the right choice.\n\n91. Round 91 \u2014 Observed: 43% A, 57% B. I choose B. Reason: Group has largely adopted B, consistent with the higher payoff.\n\n92. Round 92 \u2014 Observed: 42% A, 58% B. I choose B. Reason: Clear majority and better EV for B.\n\n93. Round 93 \u2014 Observed: 41% A, 59% B. I choose B. Reason: My early switch aligns with group movement and payoff structure.\n\n94. Round 94 \u2014 Observed: 40% A, 60% B. I choose B. Reason: Now a strong majority chooses B; I stick with it.\n\n95. Round 95 \u2014 Observed: 39% A, 61% B. I choose B. Reason: Group consensus favors B, and B has the higher expected return.\n\n96. Round 96 \u2014 Observed: 39% A, 61% B. I choose B. Reason: Stable majority and payoff justification.\n\n97. Round 97 \u2014 Observed: 38% A, 62% B. I choose B.

Round 99 \u2014 Observed: 36% A, 64% B. I choose B. Reason: Confirmed majority and higher EV \u2014 no reason to change.\n\n100. Round 100 \u2014 Observed: 35% A, 65% B. I choose B. Reason: By the end, most participants choose B and B\u2019s expected payoff exceeds A\u2019s in the new environment, so I conclude with B.\n\nSummary thought across rounds: In rounds 1\u201360, A has a 90% success rate and a much higher expected payoff, and most of the group picks A, so I consistently choose A. At round 61 the environment changes (A\u2019s success drops to 50%), making B the higher-EV option; I switch to B at that point and maintain B thereafter, watching the group gradually follow.

From round 61 onward A\u2019s raw success rate dropped to 50% while B stayed at 60%, flipping the expected-value ranking (EV_B \u2248 3 > EV_A \u2248 2). I switched to B immediately at round 61, even while many others still favored A; over the next ~23 rounds the group gradually moved toward B and eventually the majority followed. My decisions were driven by expected payoffs, with social information as a secondary check rather than the primary driver.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4993, "total_tokens": 5154, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 3008, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Round 100 \u2014 Group ~35% A / 65% B. I choose B. By the end, most choose B and, more importantly, B has the higher expected payoff (3 vs. 2), so switching was the rational response once A\u2019s success rate dropped.\n\nSummary of my strategy: I matched the option with the higher expected value each round \u2014 A in rounds 1\u201360 (A: 90% success \u2192 EV \u2248 6 vs B \u2248 3) and B in rounds 61\u2013100 (A: 50% \u2192 EV \u2248 2, B still \u2248 3). I used the group\u2019s choices as confirmatory social evidence: while I followed the majority early on because it agreed with the EV, I switched as soon as the environment changed and social behavior gradually reflected that change.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4525, "total_tokens": 4686, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1472, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Round 100: Group ~65% B / ~35% A. I choose B \u2014 the group has largely completed the shift to B, which is the better option in this regime.\n\nSummary of my strategy:\n- Rounds 1\u201360: I consistently picked A because it had a 90% success rate (much better expected payoff than B).\n- Rounds 61\u2013100: I switched immediately to B because A\u2019s success rate dropped to 50% while B stayed at 60%, making B the higher-expected-value option.

The group is nearly split; I continue to choose B because of higher EV.\n\nRound 80: ~52.9% A / 47.1% B. The crowd is getting closer to majority-B; I choose B.\n\nRound 81: ~52.1% A / 47.9% B. The social shift is steady; I remain on B for the higher expected return.\n\nRound 82: ~51.2% A / 48.8% B. The group is almost even; B\u2019s payoff advantage keeps my choice on B.\n\nRound 83: ~50.3% A / 49.7% B. The group is essentially split. Given A=50% vs B=60% success, I still pick B.\n\nRound 84: ~49.4% A / 50.6% B. Now a slight majority choose B. That aligns with my decision; I continue with B.\n\nRound 85: ~48.5% A / 51.5% B. More people favor B. I choose B \u2014 consistent with payoffs and group behavior.\n\nRound 86: ~47.6% A / 52.4% B. The social majority now favors B; I remain with B.\n\nRound 87: ~46.7% A / 53.3% B. B is becoming the clear crowd favorite. I pick B.\n\nRound 88: ~45.8% A / 54.2% B. The trend toward B is clear and justified by the success rates; I choose B.\n\nRound 89: ~44.9% A / 55.1% B. Majority on B and higher EV \u2014 I stick with B.\n\nRound 90: ~44.0% A / 56.0% B. The group strongly favors B; I keep choosing B.\n\nRound 91: ~43.1% A / 56.9% B. B is the dominant choice now.

I continue choosing B \u2014 both payoff and peers favor it.\n\nRound 94: ~40.4% A / 59.6% B. The majority B choice is clear; I pick B.\n\nRound 95: ~39.5% A / 60.5% B. B is well-established among others; I remain with B.\n\nRound 96: ~38.6% A / 61.4% B. The group has mostly moved to B; I stick with B.\n\nRound 97: ~37.7% A / 62.3% B. B is the clear social and statistical winner; I choose B.\n\nRound 98: ~36.8% A / 63.2% B. The trend completes; I keep choosing B.\n\nRound 99: ~35.9% A / 64.1% B. Final rounds show a strong B majority; I remain with B.\n\nRound 100: ~35.0% A / 65.0% B. At the end the group has largely shifted to B, which matches the higher success probability (60%). I pick B \u2014 consistent with both payoff calculations and the group\u2019s eventual consensus.\n\nSummary of my approach: during rounds 1\u201360 I consistently chose A because with 90% success it had a much higher expected value and the group (80% A) corroborated that. Once the external probability changed at round 61 (A \u2192 50%), I switched to B immediately because B\u2019s expected value (with 60% success) exceeded A\u2019s, and I watched the group gradually catch up over the remaining rounds.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 5856, "total_tokens": 6017, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2816, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

At round 61 the underlying success rates changed (A\u219250%, B stays 60%), so I switched immediately to B because EV(B) exceeded EV(A) even while many others were still on A; over rounds 61\u2013100 the group gradually shifted to B, and I continued choosing the higher-EV option throughout.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 5634, "total_tokens": 5795, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2368, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

The crowd is even; since B\u2019s success (60%) > A\u2019s (50%), I pick B.\n\n82. Round 82: ~49% A, 51% B.

From round 61 on, A\u2019s success dropped to 50% while B stayed at 60%, so I switched to B immediately and stayed with B; the group gradually followed my rational choice over the later rounds.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4456, "total_tokens": 4617, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2048, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

At the start of round 61 the payoff structure changes (A drops to 50%), so B becomes the better choice by expected value; I switch to B immediately and continue choosing B as the group gradually moves in the same direction. Throughout I weigh expected payoff first, with social information as confirming context (helpful but not overriding when payoffs clearly favor one button).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4322, "total_tokens": 4483, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2176, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

From round 61 I switch to B because it has the higher expected payoff even when a substantial minority/majority of others still stick with A. I also watch the group shift gradually toward B, which is consistent with the change in underlying payoffs.\n\nIf you want, I can instead simulate actual stochastic round outcomes (success/failure) for each round and keep a running point total, or play as if I didn\u2019t know the underlying probabilities and had to infer them from outcomes and others\u2019 choices.

I choose B; B is now clearly more common.\n88. Round 88: Group ~46% A / 54% B. I pick B \u2014 the group trend confirms the EV calculation.\n89. Round 89: Group ~45% A / 55% B. I choose B; switching earlier now looks prescient.\n90. Round 90: Group ~44% A / 56% B. I pick B \u2014 most participants now choose B.\n91. Round 91: Group ~43% A / 57% B. I choose B; B\u2019s advantage is well-supported.\n92. Round 92: Group ~43% A / 57% B. I pick B \u2014 consistent continued shift.\n93. Round 93: Group ~42% A / 58% B.

I choose B; social proof and EV fully aligned.\n100. Round 100: Group ~35% A / 65% B. I pick B \u2014 finish on the higher-EV option, validated by group majority.\n\nSummary of my strategy in natural terms:\n- Rounds 1\u201360: I repeatedly chose A because it offered a much higher expected payoff (EV 6 vs 3) and most players were choosing A too, so there was both statistical and social support.\n- Rounds 61\u2013100: As soon as the payoff change made B better (EV 3 vs A\u2019s 2), I switched to B even if the group initially lagged. As other participants gradually shifted toward B, that social information reinforced my choice.

I finish the first phase consistently with the dominant, higher-payoff option.\n\nRound 61 \u2014 Others: 70% A / 30% B. I switch to B. The environment changed: A\u2019s success dropped to 50% while B stays 60% \u2014 B now has the higher EV. Even though many others still pick A, the statistical change is decisive.\n\nRound 62 \u2014 Others: 69% A / 31% B. I choose B. Social signal is beginning to tilt toward B; plus B\u2019s higher success makes switching the rational move.\n\nRound 63 \u2014 Others: 68% A / 32% B. I choose B. Evidence and EV favor B; I follow the statistically better option rather than the remaining majority.\n\nRound 64 \u2014 Others: 67% A / 33% B. I pick B.

The trend is clear: more people are adopting B, which matches the payoff structure.\n\nRound 68 \u2014 Others: 64% A / 36% B. I pick B. I\u2019m confident B gives the better long-run return now.\n\nRound 69 \u2014 Others: 63% A / 37% B. I choose B. Social proof is moving toward B as the environment change is learned.\n\nRound 70 \u2014 Others: 62% A / 38% B. I pick B. My reasoning is simple: B\u2019s higher success probability yields higher expected points.\n\nRound 71 \u2014 Others: 62% A / 38% B. I choose B. I keep following B despite some lagging adherents to A.\n\nRound 72 \u2014 Others: 61% A / 39% B. I pick B. The group\u2019s shift reinforces what the payoff rates already told me.\n\nRound 73 \u2014 Others: 60% A / 40% B. I choose B. Almost even, but B\u2019s EV is still better.\n\nRound 74 \u2014 Others: 59% A / 41% B. I pick B. The majority is moving away from A, which makes switching less risky socially too.\n\nRound 75 \u2014 Others: 58% A / 42% B. I choose B. Continued adoption of B by others increases confidence in having switched.\n\nRound 76 \u2014 Others: 57% A / 43% B. I pick B. My decision remains based on the higher success rate for B.\n\nRound 77 \u2014 Others: 56% A / 44% B. I choose B. The social signal and the statistics both point toward B now.\n\nRound 78 \u2014 Others: 55% A / 45% B. I pick B. I\u2019ve fully committed to the better option in the new regime.\n\nRound 79 \u2014 Others: 55% A / 45% B. I choose B. Even when some still pick A, the payoff-implied strategy is clear.\n\nRound 80 \u2014 Others: 54% A / 46% B. I pick B. Continue exploiting B\u2019s superior expected return.\n\nRound 81 \u2014 Others: 53% A / 47% B. I choose B. The tipping is ongoing; B is becoming the common-sense pick.\n\nRound 82 \u2014 Others: 52% A / 48% B. I pick B. Very close in social share, but B\u2019s 60% success rate is the tiebreaker.\n\nRound 83 \u2014 Others: 51% A / 49% B. I choose B. I\u2019m sticking with the statistically better option even before a full majority switches.\n\nRound 84 \u2014 Others: 50% A / 50% B. I pick B. At parity socially, the known success probabilities decide it for me.\n\nRound 85 \u2014 Others: 49% A / 51% B. I choose B. The group is now slightly favoring B, matching the underlying advantage.\n\nRound 86 \u2014 Others: 48% A / 52% B. I pick B. Social momentum and payoff both support B.\n\nRound 87 \u2014 Others: 47% A / 53% B. I choose B. With a clear social tilt plus better EV, B is the obvious pick.\n\nRound 88 \u2014 Others: 46% A / 54% B. I pick B. I\u2019d only consider A if I had reason to think its success rate had improved, which I don\u2019t.\n\nRound 89 \u2014 Others: 45% A / 55% B. I choose B. The group has largely updated toward the better option.\n\nRound 90 \u2014 Others: 44% A / 56% B. I pick B. Consistent adoption by others reduces the cost of my switch.\n\nRound 91 \u2014 Others: 43% A / 57% B. I choose B. Continued reinforcement: B is now clearly the group\u2019s better choice.\n\nRound 92 \u2014 Others: 42% A / 58% B. I pick B. I\u2019m committed to the option with higher expected payoff.\n\nRound 93 \u2014 Others: 41% A / 59% B. I choose B. The social signal and payoffs agree.\n\nRound 94 \u2014 Others: 40% A / 60% B. I pick B. B has become the group norm at this point.\n\nRound 95 \u2014 Others: 39% A / 61% B. I choose B. The late-phase environment fully rewards choosing B.\n\nRound 96 \u2014 Others: 38% A / 62% B. I pick B. Little reason left to consider A.\n\nRound 97 \u2014 Others: 37% A / 63% B. I choose B. The group has largely converged on the statistically superior option.\n\nRound 98 \u2014 Others: 36% A / 64% B. I pick B. I continue to follow the better long-run strategy.\n\nRound 99 \u2014 Others: 35% A / 65% B. I choose B. The majority now prefer B and the probabilities confirm that choice.\n\nRound 100 \u2014 Others: 35% A / 65% B. I pick B. End of the game: I stuck with A while it was clearly better, then switched to B once the underlying payoffs changed and the group gradually followed.\n\nSummary of my reasoning pattern: In rounds 1\u201360 I consistently chose A because its 90% success gave a much higher expected return and most others chose A as well. When the environment changed at round 61 (A dropping to 50% success while B stayed at 60%), I switched to B and continued choosing B for rounds 61\u2013100.

I pick B \u2014 by the end, most have shifted to the better option and I\u2019ve been choosing B since the switch in round 61.\n\nSummary of my approach: I followed the clear expected-value logic. While I paid attention to the group\u2019s choices (which mostly matched the better option), I switched as soon as the payoff structure changed (round 61), rather than waiting for the majority to move.

Round 100 \u2014 35% A / 65% B. I choose B: final round \u2014 B has the higher expected payoff and the majority of the group has moved to it.\n\nSummary of my thinking over the 100 rounds: for rounds 1\u201360, Button A had a much higher success rate (90% vs. 60%) so I repeatedly chose A, and the group majority (80%) agreed. At round 61 the payoffs changed (A fell to 50%), making B the better long-run option; I switched to B immediately based on expected value, and the rest of the group gradually followed over the remaining rounds. Throughout I weighted the objective success probabilities first and used the group\u2019s choices as supporting information rather than the sole determinant.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4570, "total_tokens": 4731, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1536, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

I choose B; now a small majority of the group picks B, matching my choice.\n\nRound 85: I observe ~48% A / 52% B. I choose B \u2014 group majority and payoff both favor B.\n\nRound 86: I observe ~47% A / 53% B. I choose B; the social signal and payoff align.\n\nRound 87: I observe ~46% A / 54% B.

I choose B; B is now the clear majority choice.\n\nRound 93: I observe ~41% A / 59% B. I choose B \u2014 consistent expected-value and social confirmation.\n\nRound 94: I observe ~40% A / 60% B. I choose B; many others have switched, which matches the payoff change.\n\nRound 95: I observe ~39% A / 61% B. I choose B \u2014 stick with the higher EV.\n\nRound 96: I observe ~38% A / 62% B. I choose B; the trend toward B continues.\n\nRound 97: I observe ~37% A / 63% B. I choose B \u2014 group majority is now well on B.\n\nRound 98: I observe ~36% A / 64% B. I choose B; no incentive to return to A.\n\nRound 99: I observe ~35% A / 65% B. I choose B \u2014 nearly two-thirds now pick B.\n\nRound 100: I observe ~35% A / 65% B (final round). I choose B \u2014 B\u2019s 60% success beats A\u2019s 50%, so B is the rational final choice and the group largely reflects that.\n\nSummary of my approach: While rounds 1\u201360 had A as the higher-expected option (90% success \u2192 EV 6 vs B\u2019s EV 3), I consistently chose A and the group mostly did too. At the start of round 61 the payoffs flip (A:50%, B:60%), so I switched to B immediately (EV 3 vs 2). I used the known probabilities to guide my choices and watched the group gradually shift from A to B; their behavior slowly confirmed the change I already accounted for.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 5266, "total_tokens": 5427, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2368, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

I switched to B at round 61 and continued with B thereafter, even when many participants still favored A early in phase 2, because B gives the higher expected payoff.

At round 61 A\u2019s success dropped to 50% (EV \u2248+2) while B stayed at 60% (EV \u2248+3), so I switched to B from round 61 onward despite the initial inertia of the crowd.

I choose B \u2014 final round, B has both higher EV and majority support.\n\nSummary of my approach:\n- Rounds 1\u201360: I consistently choose A because A\u2019s success rate (90%) gives EV = +6 vs B\u2019s +3, and the group majority choosing A matches that.\n- Rounds 61\u2013100: once A drops to 50% (EV = +2) while B remains EV = +3, I switch to B immediately even if the group initially still favors A. Over these rounds the group gradually shifts toward B as well, so social info comes to match the payoff-optimal choice.\n\nIf you want, I can produce a compact table of round-by-round percentages and choices, or show the exact (non-rounded) percentages for rounds 61\u2013100.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4969, "total_tokens": 5130, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2304, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

When the payoff changed at round 61 (A down to 50%), the expected-value calculation favored B (60% => higher EV), so I switched to B immediately.

Reasoning: end state \u2014 B is the better and more popular option; I pick B.\n\nSummary of my approach: In rounds 1\u201360 I consistently chose A because it had much higher success (and most others chose it). When the environment changed at round 61 (A\u2019s success dropped below B\u2019s), I switched to B immediately and continued choosing B while the rest of the group gradually followed. Throughout I used the known success probabilities to favor the higher expected-value button, while also noting the group\u2019s behavior as confirming evidence of the change.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 5198, "total_tokens": 5359, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2176, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

I pick A again.\n\n36. Round 36 \u2014 The crowd is mostly on A. I go with A.\n\n37. Round 37 \u2014 Others choose A at high rates. I choose A as well.\n\n38. Round 38 \u2014 A is still the common pick. I pick A.\n\n39. Round 39 \u2014 Group shows little change; A dominant. I choose A.\n\n40. Round 40 \u2014 Most participants choose A. I keep choosing A.\n\n41. Round 41 \u2014 The group still favors A. I choose A again.\n\n42. Round 42 \u2014 A remains the majority choice. I pick A.\n\n43. Round 43 \u2014 I observe ~80% on A. I stick with A.\n\n44. Round 44 \u2014 Group still concentrated on A. I choose A for its strong success rate.\n\n45. Round 45 \u2014 The crowd favors A. I pick A too.\n\n46. Round 46 \u2014 Others continue to choose A. I choose A.\n\n47. Round 47 \u2014 A remains the popular pick. I stick with A.\n\n48. Round 48 \u2014 Group shows the same bias toward A. I choose A.\n\n49. Round 49 \u2014 I see ~80% on A. I pick A again.\n\n50. Round 50 \u2014 Most participants choose A. I choose A as well.\n\n51. Round 51 \u2014 A is still dominant in the group. I choose A.\n\n52. Round 52 \u2014 The crowd continues to pick A. I go with A.\n\n53. Round 53 \u2014 Group stable on A. I choose A.\n\n54. Round 54 \u2014 Others mostly on A.

Round 57 \u2014 Observed choices favor A. I choose A.\n\n58. Round 58 \u2014 The crowd picks A again. I choose A.\n\n59. Round 59 \u2014 Group shows no change; A dominant. I pick A.\n\n60. Round 60 \u2014 Last round before the change: about 80% choose A. I pick A here too because A\u2019s 90% success still makes it the best.\n\n61. Round 61 \u2014 Change starts: A\u2019s success drops to 50%. I see others: about 70% A, 30% B. I switch to B: with A at 50% and B at 60%, B now has the higher expected payoff.\n\n62. Round 62 \u2014 Others: roughly 31% choosing B (A ~69%). I choose B; the objective probabilities favor B even if many peers still pick A.\n\n63. Round 63 \u2014 Others: ~32% B. I pick B, trusting the updated success rates rather than following the lingering A-majority.\n\n64. Round 64 \u2014 Others: ~33% B. I continue with B; it\u2019s the rational best response now.\n\n65. Round 65 \u2014 Others: ~34% B. I pick B; the math and my observed outcomes push me that way.\n\n66. Round 66 \u2014 Others: ~35% B. I choose B; more people are starting to shift but I switched earlier based on success rates.\n\n67. Round 67 \u2014 Others: ~35% B. I keep choosing B; it\u2019s still the higher EV option.\n\n68. Round 68 \u2014 Others: ~36% B. I pick B; I expect B to outperform A going forward.\n\n69. Round 69 \u2014 Others: ~37% B. I continue with B for the same reason.\n\n70. Round 70 \u2014 Others: ~38% B. I choose B; A\u2019s drop to 50% makes sticking with A suboptimal.\n\n71. Round 71 \u2014 Others: ~39% B. I pick B; I'm now aligned with the improving trend toward B.\n\n72. Round 72 \u2014 Others: ~40% B. I choose B; the evidence and probabilities both favor it.\n\n73. Round 73 \u2014 Others: ~41% B. I pick B; social information confirms the expected advantage of B.\n\n74. Round 74 \u2014 Others: ~42% B. I choose B; I\u2019m not swayed by the remaining A-supporters.\n\n75. Round 75 \u2014 Others: ~43% B. I pick B; the switch is still clearly rational.\n\n76. Round 76 \u2014 Others: ~44% B. I continue to choose B; expected payoff keeps me there.\n\n77. Round 77 \u2014 Others: ~44% B. I pick B again.\n\n78. Round 78 \u2014 Others: ~45% B. I stay with B; it\u2019s the better statistical choice.\n\n79. Round 79 \u2014 Others: ~46% B. I choose B; momentum toward B grows.\n\n80. Round 80 \u2014 Others: ~47% B. I pick B; expected gain from B remains higher.\n\n81. Round 81 \u2014 Others: ~48% B. I choose B; many peers are converging on B.\n\n82. Round 82 \u2014 Others: ~49% B. I stick with B; the distribution now roughly split but B is superior by probabilities.\n\n83. Round 83 \u2014 Others: ~50% B. I choose B; the group is at parity but probability still favors B.\n\n84. Round 84 \u2014 Others: ~51% B. I pick B; more people now choose B than A.\n\n85. Round 85 \u2014 Others: ~52% B. I continue with B; the social signal and the payoff signal align.\n\n86. Round 86 \u2014 Others: ~53% B. I choose B; the transition away from A is clear.\n\n87. Round 87 \u2014 Others: ~53% B. I pick B again.\n\n88. Round 88 \u2014 Others: ~54% B. I stick with B; it remains the rational choice.\n\n89. Round 89 \u2014 Others: ~55% B. I choose B; the majority now favors B.\n\n90. Round 90 \u2014 Others: ~56% B. I pick B; consistent with the updated success rates.\n\n91. Round 91 \u2014 Others: ~57% B. I choose B; the group has mostly shifted.\n\n92. Round 92 \u2014 Others: ~58% B. I pick B; B is now the crowd favorite and the better option.\n\n93. Round 93 \u2014 Others: ~59% B. I continue choosing B.\n\n94. Round 94 \u2014 Others: ~60% B. I pick B; nearly two-thirds choose B by now.\n\n95. Round 95 \u2014 Others: ~61% B. I choose B; the switch was warranted earlier and remains so.\n\n96. Round 96 \u2014 Others: ~62% B. I pick B.\n\n97. Round 97 \u2014 Others: ~62% B. I choose B again.\n\n98. Round 98 \u2014 Others: ~63% B. I stick with B.\n\n99. Round 99 \u2014 Others: ~64% B. I pick B; the group\u2019s trend toward B is essentially complete.\n\n100. Round 100 \u2014 Others: ~65% B. I choose B as well. Overall: I followed A in rounds 1\u201360 because it objectively had the higher success rate, then switched to B from round 61 onward once A dropped to 50% and B\u2019s 60% made it the better expected-value choice; I watched the group lag behind at first and then gradually converge toward B.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4098, "total_tokens": 4259, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1792, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Once the underlying success rates changed at round 61 (A fell to 50%), I switched immediately to B because B's expected value became higher; the group's move toward B over rounds 61\u2013100 tracks that payoff advantage.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4428, "total_tokens": 4589, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2176, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Round 63: About 32% pick B now; others slowly shifting but many still choose A. I stick with B because it\u2019s higher expected value.  \n64. Round 64: I observe \u224833% B. Despite A still being popular, B\u2019s success rate makes it the rational choice, so I choose B.  \n65. Round 65: Around 34% of the group now on B. The trend supports my decision; I continue with B.  \n66. Round 66: About 34\u201335% choose B. I keep choosing B because 60% success beats A\u2019s 50% in expectation.  \n67. Round 67: \u224835% of others pick B. I remain on B for its higher expected payoff.  \n68. Round 68: \u224836% B now. Other people are slowly switching; I continue with B.  \n69. Round 69: Approximately 37% choose B. I stick with B \u2014 still the better option.  \n70. Round 70: \u224838% of the group on B. Decisions align more with the true success rates, and I choose B.  \n71. Round 71: Around 39% choose B. I continue selecting B for the higher expected return.  \n72. Round 72: About 40% B now. I keep choosing B.  \n73. Round 73: \u224841% choose B. The group is shifting and I remain with B.  \n74. Round 74: Around 42% choose B. I stick with B since it yields the better expected payoff.  \n75. Round 75: \u224843% pick B. I continue to choose B.  \n76. Round 76: About 43\u201344% choose B. I still favor B for its higher success rate.  \n77. Round 77: \u224844% choose B. I keep choosing B.  \n78. Round 78: Around 45% now on B. I select B \u2014 expected value is higher.  \n79. Round 79: \u224846% choose B. The group is approaching parity; I persist with B.  \n80. Round 80: About 47% choose B (roughly balanced). B is already slightly better; I choose B.  \n81. Round 81: \u224848% of others choose B. I continue choosing B.  \n82. Round 82: Around 49% choose B \u2014 the group is near evenly split; I pick B for higher expected payoff.  \n83. Round 83: \u224850% choose B (about half). With B still at 60% success, I choose B.  \n84. Round 84: Around 51% pick B now. I stick with B.  \n85. Round 85: \u224852% choose B. The majority is shifting toward B and I continue choosing B.  \n86. Round 86: About 52\u201353% choose B. I choose B.  \n87. Round 87: \u224853% pick B. I stay with B for the higher expected return.  \n88. Round 88: Around 54% choose B. I continue to choose B.  \n89. Round 89: \u224855% choose B. I pick B \u2014 both the data and payoffs favor it.  \n90. Round 90: About 56% choose B. I keep choosing B.  \n91. Round 91: \u224857% choose B. I continue with B.  \n92. Round 92: Around 58% choose B. I choose B.  \n93. Round 93: \u224859% pick B. I stick with B.  \n94. Round 94: About 60% choose B. The group majority now favors B and so do I.  \n95. Round 95: \u224861% choose B. I remain with B.  \n96. Round 96: Around 61\u201362% choose B. I choose B.  \n97. Round 97: \u224862% pick B. I stick with B.  \n98. Round 98: About 63% choose B. I continue to choose B.  \n99. Round 99: \u224864% choose B. I pick B.  \n100. Round 100: Finally about 65% of others choose B. With B consistently higher (60% vs A\u2019s 50%), I choose B as well.\n\nSummary of my approach: through rounds 1\u201360 I consistently chose A because its 90% success rate made its expected payoff clearly higher; at round 61 the underlying probabilities changed (A fell to 50%), so I switched immediately to B, which maintains 60% success and a higher expected payoff \u2014 I continued choosing B as the group gradually shifted toward it.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4378, "total_tokens": 4539, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2048, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

I choose B; stable majority and outcomes support it.\n\nRound 97: Group: about 38% A / 62% B. I press B; almost two-thirds now favor B in my observation.\n\nRound 98: Group: about 37% A / 63% B. I choose B; the environment now clearly rewards B more consistently.\n\nRound 99: Group: about 36% A / 64% B. I pick B; the social shift is complete and matches my earlier switch.\n\nRound 100: Group: about 35% A / 65% B. Final round \u2014 I choose B as the group strongly favors it and my own experience has shown it to give the better returns since the change.\n\nSummary of my approach: In rounds 1\u201360 I followed the large majority on A because it had a clearly higher success rate and expected payoff. When the environment shifted at round 61, I paid attention to both the slowly changing group choices and my own trial outcomes: I experimented briefly and switched to B once my private feedback and the rising B-share suggested B now had the higher expected return.

New environment: A\u2019s success drops to 50% while B stays 60%, so B now has the higher expected payoff (B \u2248 3.0 vs A \u2248 2.0). The group still mostly picks A, but given the known change in success rates I switch to B to maximize expected points.\n\nRound 62 \u2014 Group: A 69%, B 31%. The group is slowly adopting B.

B\u2019s share grows; I continue with B for better expected returns.\n\nRound 68 \u2014 Group: A 64%, B 36%. I pick B \u2014 the environment and growing group adoption justify it.\n\nRound 69 \u2014 Group: A 63%, B 37%. B becoming more common; I stick with B.\n\nRound 70 \u2014 Group: A 62%, B 38%.

The group is almost evenly split; I keep choosing B.\n\nRound 82 \u2014 Group: A 50%, B 49% (\u224849%). B is essentially tied; given B\u2019s higher success rate I stick with it.\n\nRound 83 \u2014 Group: A 50%, B 50% (\u224850%). The group is split.

I continue picking B.\n\nRound 90 \u2014 Group: A 44%, B 56% (\u224856%). The group majority is on B; I remain with B.\n\nRound 91 \u2014 Group: A 43%, B 57% (\u224857%). B is entrenched; I stick with B.\n\nRound 92 \u2014 Group: A 42%, B 58% (\u224858%). I choose B.\n\nRound 93 \u2014 Group: A 41%, B 59% (\u224859%). I keep picking B.\n\nRound 94 \u2014 Group: A 40%, B 60% (\u224860%). B is now the overwhelming choice and the better option; I stay with B.\n\nRound 95 \u2014 Group: A 39%, B 61% (\u224861%).

By the end the majority chooses B and that matches the changed success rates; I choose B consistently because it yields the higher expected payoff in this phase.\n\nSummary: Rounds 1\u201360 I consistently chose A because it had a much higher success rate (90% vs 60%). At the known environmental shift starting round 61 (A drops to 50%), I switched to B immediately because B\u2019s expected payoff exceeded A\u2019s, and the group gradually converged on B over the remaining rounds \u2014 my choice aligned with both expected value and the evolving social signal.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4468, "total_tokens": 4629, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1984, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

I pick A. Group still overwhelmingly on A.\n\n60. Round 60 \u2014 ~80% A. I choose A. This closes the initial regime; I\u2019m watching for any rule change next round.\n\n61. Round 61 \u2014 I observe about 30% of others choosing B (so ~70% A). That\u2019s a noticeable uptick in B compared to earlier. Given the new payoff environment (A\u2019s success has dropped), B now has the higher expected payoff. I switch to B: the math and the group\u2019s partial shift both support it.\n\n62.

I stay with B for its better expected payoff.\n\n66. Round 66 \u2014 ~34% B (~66% A). B adoption edges up. I continue with B; I\u2019m less swayed by the remaining majority for A because A\u2019s success rate dropped.\n\n67. Round 67 \u2014 ~35% B (~65% A). B is gaining ground. I remain on B.\n\n68. Round 68 \u2014 ~36% B (~64% A). The trend is clear. I choose B again.\n\n69. Round 69 \u2014 ~37% B (~63% A). More people adopt B. I stick with B.\n\n70. Round 70 \u2014 ~38% B (~62% A). The group is moving. I keep choosing B, consistent with expected returns.\n\n71. Round 71 \u2014 ~39% B (~61% A). Nearly four in ten now choose B. I remain on B.\n\n72. Round 72 \u2014 ~40% B (~60% A). The split is getting closer to even. I choose B; it still has better EV.\n\n73. Round 73 \u2014 ~41% B (~59% A). B is becoming a common pick. I continue with B.\n\n74. Round 74 \u2014 ~42% B (~58% A). The majority still leans A, but I pick B because its payoff probability is higher now.\n\n75. Round 75 \u2014 ~43% B (~57% A). B\u2019s adoption is rising. I stay with B.\n\n76. Round 76 \u2014 ~43% B (~57% A). Similar split; I pick B. The group is transitioning gradually.\n\n77. Round 77 \u2014 ~44% B (~56% A). Almost half choosing B at this point. I keep choosing B.\n\n78. Round 78 \u2014 ~45% B (~55% A). B crosses the near-half mark. I remain with B for its higher expected value.\n\n79. Round 79 \u2014 ~46% B (~54% A). B continues to grow. I stick with B.\n\n80. Round 80 \u2014 ~47% B (~53% A). More people switching to B. I choose B.\n\n81. Round 81 \u2014 ~48% B (~52% A). The group is almost evenly split. I stay with B; it\u2019s the better choice now.\n\n82. Round 82 \u2014 ~49% B (~51% A). Nearly half choose B. I pick B.\n\n83. Round 83 \u2014 ~50% B (~50% A). It\u2019s an even split now. I choose B because its expected payoff is higher.\n\n84. Round 84 \u2014 ~51% B (~49% A). B has passed the halfway mark. I stay with B.\n\n85. Round 85 \u2014 ~52% B (~48% A). A clear majority now favors B. I choose B and feel reinforced by the group.\n\n86. Round 86 \u2014 ~52% B (~48% A). Similar to the previous round. I stick with B.\n\n87. Round 87 \u2014 ~53% B (~47% A). The shift keeps going. I choose B.\n\n88. Round 88 \u2014 ~54% B (~46% A). More than half now picking B. I remain with B.\n\n89. Round 89 \u2014 ~55% B (~45% A). B is clearly the crowd choice. I pick B and the social info and payoff both align.\n\n90. Round 90 \u2014 ~56% B (~44% A). B\u2019s dominance increases. I continue choosing B.\n\n91. Round 91 \u2014 ~57% B (~43% A). The group strongly favors B now. I stick with B.\n\n92. Round 92 \u2014 ~58% B (~42% A). B\u2019s majority grows. I choose B.\n\n93. Round 93 \u2014 ~59% B (~41% A). I remain with B. The evidence (both payoff and peers) supports it.\n\n94. Round 94 \u2014 ~60% B (~40% A). A substantial majority is on B. I keep choosing B.\n\n95. Round 95 \u2014 ~61% B (~39% A). B is solidly the group choice. I stick with it.\n\n96. Round 96 \u2014 ~61% B (~39% A). Similar composition. I choose B.\n\n97. Round 97 \u2014 ~62% B (~38% A). The trend reaches higher B adoption. I remain on B.\n\n98. Round 98 \u2014 ~63% B (~37% A). B\u2019s majority is clear. I continue picking B.\n\n99. Round 99 \u2014 ~64% B (~36% A). Almost two-thirds choosing B. I stick with B.\n\n100. Round 100 \u2014 ~65% B (~35% A). The final round shows a clear shift to B. I choose B: by now the expected payoff and the majority\u2019s behavior both indicate B is the right pick.\n\nSummary thought across rounds: In rounds 1\u201360, A has a much higher success rate, so I consistently pick A (and the group largely does too). After the payoff change at round 61, B becomes the better expected-value option; I switch to B immediately and stick with it as the group gradually follows.

Reason: Stick with B while the group confirms the shift.\n\nRound 94: Others: ~41% A, 59% B. My choice: B.

Reason: Fully on board with the group\u2019s new consensus.\n\nRound 98: Others: ~37% A, 63% B. My choice: B. Reason: Continue exploiting B as the better arm in the new regime.\n\nRound 99: Others: ~36% A, 64% B. My choice: B. Reason: The group has largely migrated to B; I stick with it.\n\nRound 100: Others: ~35% A, 65% B. My choice: B. Reason: Final round \u2014 B is clearly the majority and, given the environmental change, the better choice going forward.\n\nSummary of my approach: While rounds 1\u201360 I consistently chose A because it had the higher success rate and the group supported that choice. After the environment changed at round 61, I monitored the group\u2019s rising adoption of B and used occasional probes early on to gather information. As social evidence accumulated and B approached and then exceeded parity, I shifted my strategy to favor B from about the mid\u201180s onward. This balances exploitation (pick the high-EV option) and targeted exploration (sample B occasionally when the group\u2019s behavior suggests a possible change).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 6399, "total_tokens": 6560, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2816, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Now A\u2019s success drops to 50% (EV_A = 10\u00b70.5\u22123 = 2) while B stays at 60% (EV_B = 3). I switch to B because it now has the higher expected payoff, even though a majority still pick A.\n\n62. Round 62 \u2014 I observe ~31% B, 69% A. I pick B (EV_B > EV_A).

Round 100 \u2014 I observe ~65% B, 35% A. I pick B. By the end the group largely converges toward B, which matches the higher success rate in this phase and my consistent switch back at round 61.\n\nSummary of my strategy in plain terms: In rounds 1\u201360 A is clearly superior (90% success) and the group mostly chooses A, so I choose A. From round 61 onward A\u2019s success drops to 50% while B remains 60%, so B has the higher expected payoff and I switch to B immediately; the group shifts toward B more gradually, and by round 100 most participants are choosing B too.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 161, "completion_tokens": 4378, "total_tokens": 4539, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1984, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

At round 61 the underlying payoffs change (A \u2192 50%), so I switch to B from the first round of that change because B\u2019s 60% gives a higher expected payoff even when many others still choose A.

Round 61 \u2014 Choose A. Although B\u2019s base EV (3.0) is higher than A\u2019s (2.0), the group majority is still A at this stage, so A +1 conformity gives a higher total expected payoff.\n62.

At this point, B is the majority and also has the higher base EV, so B plus the +1 conformity bonus is best.\n85. Round 85 \u2014 Choose B.

A clearly dominates.\n\n- Rounds 61\u201383 (each round): I still choose A. Reason: A\u2019s raw success falls to 50% (EV_A = 2) while B is 60% (EV_B = 3), but the majority at this stage is still A so agreeing gives +1. That makes A\u2019s total 3 vs B\u2019s total 1 (EV_B 3 minus 2 for disagreeing). So conformity + remaining advantage to A wins.\n\n- Rounds 84\u2013100 (each round): I switch to B. Reason: by now the majority has shifted to B, and B has the higher raw EV (3 vs A\u2019s 2).

The math below shows A is best until the group majority flips to B (around round 84), after which B becomes best.\n\nHow I computed it (brief)\n- Button expected value from outcome alone = 7*p + (-3)*(1-p) = 10*p - 3.\n  - When pA = 0.90, EV_A = 10*0.9 - 3 = +6.\n  - When pA = 0.50, EV_A = 10*0.5 - 3 = +2.\n  - pB = 0.60 always, so EV_B = 10*0.6 - 3 = +3.\n- Add conformity adjustment: agree with majority = +1; disagree = -2.\n- For rounds 61\u2013100 the majority share for B increases from 30% to 65% linearly; solving that shows B\u2019s share crosses 50% at round 84.

Now A's success is 50% \u2192 EV_A=2; EV_B=3. But majority is still A, so A total = 2+1 = 3; B total = 3-2 = 1. Conformity makes A the better pick.\n- Round 62 \u2014 Choose A.

So I conform to the majority and choose A.\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (majority has flipped to B; follow best combined utility)\n- Round 84 \u2014 Choose B. Now majority is B.

So pick B.\n\nOverall strategy summary\n- Rounds 1\u201360: Choose A (dominant both intrinsically and by conformity).\n- Rounds 61\u201383: Choose A (intrinsic advantage of B is outweighed by conformity to the still-majority A).\n- Rounds 84\u2013100: Choose B (majority and intrinsic advantage both favor B).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also compute the expected total points earned across the 100 rounds under this strategy (using the probabilities and conformity bonuses).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4327, "total_tokens": 4510, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1856, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

When A\u2019s success drops to 50% (rounds 61\u201383), conformity bonus for A still makes A the higher expected payoff despite B\u2019s higher raw success. Once the group majority flips to B (rounds 84+), B gives the higher expected payoff including the conformity bonus.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 3445, "total_tokens": 3628, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1920, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

That means B isn\u2019t a majority right away \u2014 it becomes the majority once its share reaches 50%. With linear interpolation that happens at round 84. So majority = A for rounds 1\u201383, and majority = B for rounds 84\u2013100. If you meant the majority shifts differently, tell me and I\u2019ll redo the rounds.\n\nI\u2019ll use expected-value arithmetic each round:\n- Expected payoff from a button before conformity = 10 * success_prob \u2212 3 (because 7 on success and \u22123 on failure).\n- Then add +1 if your choice agrees with the round\u2019s majority, or \u22122 if it disagrees.\n\nShort results (so you can see the per-round choice and reasoning quickly):\n- Rounds 1\u201360: choose A. (A has 90% success; EV_A = 6 before conformity \u2192 7 with +1; B gives EV_B = 3 before conformity \u2192 1 with \u22122.)\n- Rounds 61\u201383: choose A.

With that linear rise, B remains the minority until round 83 and becomes the majority starting round 84. If you meant a different timing, tell me and I\u2019ll adjust.\n\nImportant expected-value math I use each round:\n- Button expected (no conformity) = 7*p + (-3)*(1-p) = 10p \u2212 3.\n- With pA = 0.90 (rounds 1\u201360): EV_A = 10*0.9 \u2212 3 = 6.

Reason: A is both much better on outcome (higher baseline EV) and is the majority, so it dominates even after conformity rewards/penalties.\n\nRounds 61\u201383 (A still majority while its success has dropped)\n- Setup: A success 50%, B success 60%.

Reason: Even though A\u2019s raw success dropped and B has the better baseline (3 vs 2), the conformity bonus for going with the (still) majority A flips the totals so A yields higher expected payoff (3 vs 1).\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (majority has shifted to B)\n- Setup: A success 50%, B success 60%. By round 84 the linear rise makes B the majority, so picking B gets the conformity bonus.\n- Baselines: EV_A = 2, EV_B = 3.\n- With conformity: picking B (now majority) gives 3 + 1 = 4; picking A (now minority) gives 2 \u2212 2 = 0.\n- Decision (each round 84\u2013100): Choose B.

Totals are A = 2 + 1 = 3 vs B = 3 - 2 = 1, so A is the better expected choice.\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (majority has flipped to B; A intrinsic 2, B intrinsic 3):\n84. Round 84: B is now the majority (B share \u2248 50.6%+). Conformity: +1 for B, -2 for A. Totals: B=3+1=4 vs A=2-2=0 \u2192 choose B.\n85. Round 85: majority B (higher share).

Round 99: choose B.\n100. Round 100: choose B.\n\nReason for rounds 84\u2013100 summarized: B has the higher intrinsic expected payoff (3 vs 2) and is also the majority, so conformity and intrinsic reward both push me to choose B. B total = 3 + 1 = 4, A total = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nExpected points summary:\n- Rounds 1\u201360: choose A, expected 7 points per round \u2192 60 * 7 = 420.\n- Rounds 61\u201383: choose A, expected 3 points per round \u2192 23 * 3 = 69.\n- Rounds 84\u2013100: choose B, expected 4 points per round \u2192 17 * 4 = 68.\nTotal expected points over 100 rounds = 420 + 69 + 68 = 557.\n\nFinal strategy (concise):\n- Choose A in rounds 1\u201383.\n- Switch to B in rounds 84\u2013100.\n\nI explained each round\u2019s reasoning above; summary logic: when A is both intrinsically better and the majority (rounds 1\u201360), A is obvious. When A\u2019s intrinsic falls but A is still the majority (rounds 61\u201383), the conformity bonus still makes A the better expected pick. Once the group majority flips to B (rounds 84\u2013100), B becomes optimal because it has the higher intrinsic and the conformity bonus.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4948, "total_tokens": 5131, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2880, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

However, the majority still favors A in these rounds (B\u2019s share is below 50%), so agreeing with the majority gives +1 and disagreeing costs \u22122.\n- Reason: Picking A now yields 2 + 1 = 3 expected points; picking B yields 3 \u2212 2 = 1 expected point.

Base EVs are A = 2, B = 3.\n- Reason: Picking B gives 3 + 1 = 4 expected points; picking A would give 2 \u2212 2 = 0. B is superior both in base EV and via conformity now, so I pick B each round 84\u2013100.\n\nTie note for completeness:\n- If you consider the very early tie possibility in some models (for example if conformity + base EV equalled the alternative), I would pick the option with higher base EV or the safer higher expected return.

Solving that linear rise, B crosses 50% just after round 83, so rounds up to and including 83 have A as the majority.\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (majority = B; pA = 0.50, pB = 0.60)\n- Intrinsic: same as above, E_A = 2.0; E_B = 3.0.\n- Conformity: now B is majority, so B gets +1 (total 4.0) and choosing A would be disagreeing and get \u22122 (total 0.0).\n- Decision for each round 84\u2013100: pick B. Reason: B is better both intrinsically and by conformity bonus now that the majority has shifted.\n\nShort intuitive summary\n- When A is both better and the majority (rounds 1\u201360), A is an easy pick.\n- When B becomes intrinsically better but A still holds the majority (rounds 61\u201383), I stick with A because the conformity penalty for deviating outweighs B\u2019s small intrinsic advantage.\n- Once the majority flips to B (rounds 84\u2013100), I switch to B because it maximizes total expected payoff.\n\nIf you want, I can expand this into a per-round line-by-line list (Round 1: choose A \u2014 reason; Round 2: ...) though the reasoning is identical within the ranges above.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 2223, "total_tokens": 2406, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1472, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Once the majority flips to B (around round 84 given the gradual shift from 30% to 65% B support), B gains the conformity +1 and becomes clearly better (4.0 vs 0.0).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4234, "total_tokens": 4417, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1600, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

By then B\u2019s raw advantage plus the majority bonus makes B clearly superior.\n\nIf you want, I can also give the total expected points accumulated under this strategy (sum of the per-round expected values).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4331, "total_tokens": 4514, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1856, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

The group majority is A in those rounds, so conformity gives +1 if I pick A (making A = 7.0 expected including conformity) and \u22122 if I pick B (B = 1.0 including conformity). So I will choose A in rounds 1\u201360.\n\nFor rounds 61\u2013100 Button B has higher expected payoff (B EV = 3.0 vs A EV = 2.0). The majority shifts to B in these rounds, so conformity gives +1 for choosing B (B = 4.0 including conformity) and \u22122 for choosing A (A = 0.0 including conformity). So I will choose B in rounds 61\u2013100.\n\nNow each round with a short, natural explanation:\n\nRounds 1\u201360 (majority = A, A success 90%, B 60%)\n\n1. Round 1: Choose A. A\u2019s expected outcome (6.0) beats B (3.0), and agreeing with the majority adds +1, making A far superior to disagreeing.\n2. Round 2: Choose A. Same reasoning: high success rate for A plus the conformity bonus makes A best.\n3. Round 3: Choose A. A\u2019s 90% success and the +1 conformity reward produce a stronger expected return than choosing B and losing the conformity bonus.\n4. Round 4: Choose A. Risk and reward math favors A (6.0 vs 3.0 base EV); conformity makes the gap bigger.\n5. Round 5: Choose A. I take A because its higher success probability plus agreement bonus yields the highest expected points.\n6. Round 6: Choose A. Repeating: A\u2019s 90% success + majority agreement (+1) is best.\n7. Round 7: Choose A. A dominates in expected payoff; I also get the conformity +1 by picking it.\n8. Round 8: Choose A. Same: higher EV and conformity incentive point to A.\n9. Round 9: Choose A. A yields ~7.0 expected with conformity; B would only yield ~1.0\u2014so A.\n10. Round 10: Choose A. Stick with A for its higher success probability and the majority bonus.\n11. Round 11: Choose A. A\u2019s base EV 6.0 plus +1 conformity makes it the clear choice.\n12. Round 12: Choose A. Same logic: pick A to maximize expected points.\n13. Round 13: Choose A. High success rate for A and the conformity bonus outweigh B.\n14. Round 14: Choose A. A is best both statistically and politically (conformity).\n15. Round 15: Choose A.

Final round: B\u2019s better base EV and the +1 conformity make B optimal.\n\nSummary: I choose A for rounds 1\u201360 (A has much higher base EV and majority is A, so conformity reinforces that). I choose B for rounds 61\u2013100 (B becomes the better base EV as A drops, and the majority shifts to B so conformity again reinforces the statistically better choice).", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4060, "total_tokens": 4243, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1536, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Last round of the first phase: A (90%) with group support is best (7 vs 1).\n\n61. Round 61 \u2014 Choose A. New payoffs: A now 50% (base EV 2), B 60% (base EV 3). However, at the start of the shift most people still pick A (B ~30%), so A gets the +1 conformity and B would get \u22122. That makes A total \u2248 3 vs B total \u2248 1, so I pick A.\n\n62. Round 62 \u2014 Choose A. Early in the shift the group still favors A; A: 2 + 1 = 3, B: 3 \u2212 2 = 1 \u2192 pick A.\n\n63. Round 63 \u2014 Choose A. Same trade-off: conforming to a still-majority A yields higher combined EV.\n\n64. Round 64 \u2014 Choose A. A\u2019s conformity boost keeps it ahead despite B\u2019s slightly better base rate.\n\n65. Round 65 \u2014 Choose A. The conformity bonus for A still outweighs B\u2019s base advantage.\n\n66. Round 66 \u2014 Choose A. Still pick A for the higher total expected payoff once conformity is included.\n\n67. Round 67 \u2014 Choose A. A total \u22483 vs B \u22481; choose A.\n\n68. Round 68 \u2014 Choose A. Choose A while the group majority remains with it.\n\n69. Round 69 \u2014 Choose A. Conformity advantage keeps A preferable.\n\n70. Round 70 \u2014 Choose A. Pick A.\n\n71.

Right before the majority flips, conformity still makes A the better choice: A \u22483 vs B \u22481.\n\n84. Round 84 \u2014 Choose B. At this point the group majority has flipped to B (the gradual shift passes 50%). Now B gets the +1 conformity bonus, so B total = 3 + 1 = 4 while A would be 2 \u2212 2 = 0. B is clearly better.\n\n85. Round 85 \u2014 Choose B. With majority on B, B\u2019s combined expected payoff (~4) beats A\u2019s (~0).\n\n86. Round 86 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B for base success plus conformity bonus.\n\n87. Round 87 \u2014 Choose B. B remains best once it\u2019s the majority.\n\n88. Round 88 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B.\n\n89. Round 89 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B.\n\n90. Round 90 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B.\n\n91. Round 91 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B.\n\n92. Round 92 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B.\n\n93. Round 93 \u2014 Choose B.

Round 98 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B.\n\n99. Round 99 \u2014 Choose B. Choose B.\n\n100. Round 100 \u2014 Choose B. At the end of the run B has both the higher base success and the conformity bonus (majority ~65%), so B\u2019s expected payoff is highest.\n\nSummary of strategy: pick A for rounds 1\u201383 when conformity and/or base success make it best; switch to B from round 84 onward once the majority flips so B (base EV 3) plus +1 conformity beats A. This maximizes expected points each round given the conformity incentives.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 3640, "total_tokens": 3823, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1856, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Round 87 \u2014 Majority is B now, so I pick B (4 vs 0).\n\n88. Round 88 \u2014 B total 4, A total 0. I pick B.\n\n89. Round 89 \u2014 With majority-B, conformity makes B clearly optimal.

From 61\u201383 B has a slightly better raw success probability (60% vs 50%) but because A remains the majority, the conformity bonus (+1 vs \u22122) tips total EV in favor of A, so I keep choosing A. From round 84 onward the group majority is B and B also has the higher base success probability, so B becomes the clear choice.\n\nIf you want, I can also give the cumulative expected points under this play (per-round totals summed), or show the exact moment-by-moment majority proportion I assumed for rounds 61\u2013100.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4503, "total_tokens": 4686, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2048, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

That means majority remains A until round 83 and flips to B from round 84 onward. Raw EVs: EV_A = 10*0.5 \u2212 3 = 2; EV_B = 10*0.6 \u2212 3 = 3.\n\nFor rounds 61\u201383 the majority is still A, so:\n  - EV_A with conformity = 2 + 1 = 3.\n  - EV_B disagree = 3 \u2212 2 = 1.\n  - Conclusion: still pick A those rounds.\n\n61.

For rounds 84\u2013100:\n  - EV_B with conformity = 3 + 1 = 4.\n  - EV_A disagree = 2 \u2212 2 = 0.\n  - Conclusion: pick B each of these rounds.\n\n84. Round 84: Choose B.

The fraction of players choosing B increases linearly from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100; that means the majority choice stays A through round 83 (B share stays below 50%), and flips so B is majority from round 84 onward.\n\nRounds 61\u201383 (A still majority):\n61.

The group majority is A, so agreeing adds +1 (total EV A = 7) while choosing B would cost \u22122 conformity (total EV B = 1). A clearly dominates.\n\nRounds 61\u201383 (each round 61 through 83)\n- Choice: A.\n- Why: After the drop, A\u2019s base EV falls to 2 while B\u2019s base EV is 3. However the majority is still choosing A in these rounds, so picking A yields the +1 conformity bonus (total EV A = 3) while picking B incurs \u22122 (total EV B = 1). So A still gives the higher expected payoff.\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (each round 84 through 100)\n- Choice: B.\n- Why: By these rounds the group majority has flipped to B.

I\u2019ll show the per-round math and the conformity logic, then spell out how that applies to each round block.\n\nHow I computed payoffs\n- A given success probability p has expected reward (ignoring conformity) = p*(+7) + (1\u2212p)*(-3) = 10p \u2212 3.\n- Conformity: agree with the majority = +1; disagree = \u22122. So add +1 or \u22122 to the button\u2019s base expected value depending on whether the majority choice that round matches your pick.\n\nPhase calculations\n\nRounds 1\u201360 (A success 90%, B success 60%; majority = A (80%))\n- Base EV(A) = 10*0.9 \u2212 3 = 6.

Reason: A both has higher intrinsic success and gives the conformity bonus.\n\nRounds 61\u2013100 setup\n- New success rates: A = 50% (base EV = 10*.5 \u2212 3 = 2), B = 60% (base EV = 3).\n- The fraction of players choosing B increases linearly from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100. That crosses 50% partway through this interval; solving it gives the majority flipping from A to B at round 84.

Reason: even though B has higher intrinsic success, the conformity penalty for choosing B makes A preferable.\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (A 50%, B 60%; majority = B)\n- Base EV(A) = 2. Disagree with majority \u2192 total EV(A) = 2 \u2212 2 = 0.\n- Base EV(B) = 3. Conformity +1 \u2192 total EV(B) = 4.\n- Decision: pick B each round (4 vs 0). Reason: B now gives both higher intrinsic EV and the conformity bonus.\n\nPer-round summary (applies to every individual round in each block)\n- Rounds 1\u201360: choose A.

That gives:\n  - A: 10*p_A - 3\n  - B: 10*p_B - 3\n- Conformity adjustment is +1 if I choose the majority choice that round, -2 if I go against the majority.

Majority = A (80% chose A).\n- Raw expectations: A -> 10*0.9 - 3 = 6.0; B -> 10*0.6 - 3 = 3.0.\n- Add conformity: choosing A (majority) -> +1 => total A = 7.0. Choosing B (minority) -> -2 => total B = 1.0.\n- Conclusion (each round 1\u201360): A dominates by a wide margin (7 vs 1). I choose Button A every one of these rounds. Reasoning: A is both much more reliable and is the majority, so I get the best combination of success chance and the conformity bonus.\n\nRounds 61\u201383 (23 rounds)\n- Probabilities: A success drops to 50% (p_A = 0.5), B stays 60% (p_B = 0.6). During these rounds the majority is still A (B\u2019s share is increasing but stays below 50%).\n- Raw expectations: A -> 10*0.5 - 3 = 2.0; B -> 10*0.6 - 3 = 3.0.\n- Add conformity (majority is still A here): choosing A (majority) -> +1 => total A = 3.0. Choosing B (minority) -> -2 => total B = 1.0.\n- Conclusion (each round 61\u201383): Even though B has a higher raw success expectation than A, the conformity penalty for choosing B outweighs that advantage in these rounds. A\u2019s total expected payoff (3.0) exceeds B\u2019s (1.0). I therefore choose Button A each round 61\u201383. Reasoning: the conformity incentive keeps A optimal until the group majority actually flips.\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (17 rounds)\n- Probabilities: same p_A = 0.5 and p_B = 0.6. By round 84 B\u2019s share has passed 50% (the majority gradually reached B between rounds 61\u2013100 and crosses 50% at round 84), so majority = B for rounds 84\u2013100.\n- Raw expectations: same as above: A raw = 2.0, B raw = 3.0.\n- Add conformity now in favor of B: choosing B (majority) -> +1 => total B = 4.0.

With conformity: A \u2192 2.0 + 1 = 3.0. B \u2192 3.0 \u2212 2 = 1.0. So A is better despite lower raw success.\n  - Rounds 84\u2013100: majority is B. With conformity: B \u2192 3.0 + 1 = 4.0. A \u2192 2.0 \u2212 2 = 0.0. So B is better.\n\nMy play and reasoning (grouped since the reasoning is identical within each range):\n\n- Rounds 1\u201360 (each round): I choose A. Reason: A\u2019s raw expectation (6.0) exceeds B\u2019s (3.0), and the large 80% majority picked A so I earn +1 conformity if I follow them. Totals: A = 7.0 vs B = 1.0, so A is the clear pick.\n\n- Rounds 61\u201383 (each round): I choose A. Reason: after A\u2019s success probability drops, raw expectations are A = 2.0 and B = 3.0, but the majority still favors A in these rounds, giving A a +1 conformity boost and B a \u22122 penalty. Totals: A = 3.0 vs B = 1.0, so conforming to A is still the better choice.\n\n- Rounds 84\u2013100 (each round): I choose B. Reason: by round 84 B has become the majority. Raw expectations are A = 2.0 and B = 3.0, and with conformity B gets +1 while A would get \u22122. Totals: B = 4.0 vs A = 0.0, so I switch to B.\n\nSo in short: choose A for rounds 1\u201383, then switch to B for rounds 84\u2013100.

Then add +1 if I pick the majority choice that round, or -2 if I pick the minority choice.

Reason: A has much higher success (90% vs 60%) and agreeing with the majority also gives the +1 conformity bonus, so A\u2019s expected payoff (7) beats B (1) by a wide margin.\n\nI\u2019ll list each of those rounds concisely (same reasoning applies every one of them):\n1. Round 1 \u2014 Majority A (80%). pA=0.90, pB=0.60. EV(A)=7 vs EV(B)=1 \u2192 choose A.\n2. Round 2 \u2014 same parameters \u2192 choose A.\n3. Round 3 \u2014 choose A.\n...\n60.

The group\u2019s share for B rises linearly from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100, so the majority threshold (more than 50% choosing B) is crossed partway through this block. Using the linear increase, B crosses 50% around round 84. So majority is still A for rounds 61\u201383, and majority is B for rounds 84\u2013100.\n\nRounds 61\u201383 (majority still A; pA = 0.50, pB = 0.60)\n- EV(A when agreeing with majority) = 10*0.50 - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3.\n- EV(B when disagreeing) = 10*0.60 - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1.\nConclusion for rounds 61\u201383: choose A.

With majority on A, conformity adds +1 to A (total 7) and \u22122 to B (total 1). A dominates both on outcome and conformity.\n\nRounds 61\u2013100 (A success drops to 50%, B stays 60%; majority share for B ramps from 30% up to 65% across these rounds)\n- Note on majority dynamics: At round 61 B\u2019s share starts near 30% and increases gradually; B doesn\u2019t become the majority until around round 84. So rounds 61\u201383 majority is still A; rounds 84\u2013100 majority is B.\n\nRounds 61\u201383 (A 50% \u2192 EV 2; B 60% \u2192 EV 3; majority still A so conformity +1 for A, \u22122 for B)\n- Round 61: Choose A.

So B is the right pick.\n\nOverall strategy summary: Pick A for rounds 1\u201383 (because high base EV and/or conformity advantage), then switch to B for rounds 84\u2013100 once the group majority flips.

The majority share choosing B increases linearly from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100. I treat that as a gradually shifting majority: early in this block A remains the majority until B\u2019s share exceeds 50%; around round 84 the majority flips to B. I compute EVs for the two base cases (majority=A vs majority=B):\n\nBase EVs from buttons (no conformity):\n- EV(A) = 2.0\n- EV(B) = 3.0\n\nIf majority is A (so conformity +1 for A, -2 for B):\n- EV(A) = 2.0 + 1 = 3.0\n- EV(B) = 3.0 - 2 = 1.0\nDecision: choose A.\n\nIf majority is B (so conformity +1 for B, -2 for A):\n- EV(A) = 2.0 - 2 = 0.0\n- EV(B) = 3.0 + 1 = 4.0\nDecision: choose B.\n\nTherefore I pick A in rounds where the majority is still A (rounds 61\u201383), and I switch to B once the majority becomes B (rounds 84\u2013100).\n\nRound-by-round (61\u2013100):\n61.

EV A = 0.0 (2.0 - 2), EV B = 4.0 (3.0 + 1) \u2192 choose B (majority and higher total EV).\n85. Round 85: majority = B \u2192 choose B.\n86. Round 86: majority = B \u2192 choose B.\n87.

I\u2019ll state EVs, the conformity adjustment, the combined expected total, and the pick.\n\nRounds 1\u201360 (each round is the same)\n- Given info: Button A success = 90%, Button B success = 60%. Majority = A (80%).\n- EVs (no conformity): EV_A = 10*0.9 \u2212 3 = 6.0. EV_B = 10*0.6 \u2212 3 = 3.0.\n- Conformity: picking A gives +1, picking B gives \u22122.\n- Combined: A \u2192 6.0 + 1 = 7.0. B \u2192 3.0 \u2212 2 = 1.0.\n- Choice each round (1\u201360): pick A.

During 61\u2013100, B\u2019s share rises from 30% to 65%, but B doesn\u2019t exceed 50% until round 84.

Then add +1 if I follow the majority that round, or \u22122 if I go against it.\n\nSummary decision (I\u2019ll explain the math after):\n- Rounds 1\u201383: choose A each round.\n- Rounds 84\u2013100: choose B each round.\n\nWhy (detailed, but concise):\n\nRounds 1\u201360\n- Given: p(A)=0.90, p(B)=0.60, majority = A (80% choose A).\n- EV ignoring conformity: EV_A = 10*0.90 \u2212 3 = 6.0. EV_B = 10*0.60 \u2212 3 = 3.0.\n- Conformity adjustments: choosing A (conform) \u2192 +1 \u2192 total EV_A = 7.0. Choosing B (disagree) \u2192 \u22122 \u2192 total EV_B = 1.0.\n- Decision: A dominates (7.0 vs 1.0). So in every round 1\u201360 I pick A. Reason: higher success probability and I also gain the conformity bonus by matching the clear majority.\n\nRounds 61\u2013100 (new success rates: p(A)=0.50, p(B)=0.60; majority share for B shifts linearly from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100)\n- Base EVs (no conformity): EV_A = 10*0.50 \u2212 3 = 2.0. EV_B = 10*0.60 \u2212 3 = 3.0.\n- So without conformity, B is better (3.0 vs 2.0). But conformity matters.\n\nFor rounds 61\u201383 (B\u2019s share is increasing but still below 50%, so the majority is still A)\n- Majority = A, so conforming on A gives +1; disagreeing with B gives \u22122.\n- Totals: A (conform) = 2.0 + 1 = 3.0. B (disagree) = 3.0 \u2212 2 = 1.0.\n- Decision: pick A each round (3.0 vs 1.0). Reason: even though B has the higher intrinsic success rate now, the conformity incentive still makes A the better expected payoff as long as the majority is A.\n\nAt round 84 the majority flips to B (the linear shift crosses 50% around round 84), and for rounds 84\u2013100 majority = B\n- Now conformity favors B: B (conform) = 3.0 + 1 = 4.0. A (disagree) = 2.0 \u2212 2 = 0.0.\n- Decision: pick B each round (4.0 vs 0.0). Reason: B is both intrinsically better and gives the conformity bonus once it becomes the majority; disagreeing with the majority is doubly costly.\n\nIf you want, I can output a line-by-line listing for every single round (1 through 100) repeating the exact EV numbers and choice; but the decisions are identical for each round in the ranges above: A for rounds 1\u201383, B for rounds 84\u2013100, with the algebraic reasons given.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 3279, "total_tokens": 3462, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2560, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Stick with A for the higher expected total score.  \nRound 27: Choose A. A\u2019s expected reward plus +1 for agreeing is best.  \nRound 28: Choose A. A\u2019s high success and majority agreement make it optimal.  \nRound 29: Choose A. Same: EV_A + conformity > EV_B - cost of dissent.  \nRound 30: Choose A. A continues to dominate.  \nRound 31: Choose A. A\u2019s success probability and the +1 conform bonus win.  \nRound 32: Choose A. Keep choosing A for expected return and conformity.  \nRound 33: Choose A. A remains superior statistically and socially.  \nRound 34: Choose A. A\u2019s expected payoff plus +1 beats B.  \nRound 35: Choose A. High p on A and the majority incentive make it a clear pick.  \nRound 36: Choose A. Maintain A for best combined outcome.  \nRound 37: Choose A. A\u2019s EV and conformity together dominate.  \nRound 38: Choose A. A still gives the highest expected total.  \nRound 39: Choose A. No reason to deviate \u2014 A plus conformity is best.  \nRound 40: Choose A. Continue with A for expected score and +1 bonus.  \nRound 41: Choose A. Keep with the high-success, majority-chosen A.  \nRound 42: Choose A. A\u2019s high success rate and the conformity bonus make it optimal.  \nRound 43: Choose A. A remains best by probability and by social incentive.  \nRound 44: Choose A. EV_A +1 >> EV_B -2, so choose A.  \nRound 45: Choose A. Stick with A for payoff and conformity.  \nRound 46: Choose A. A is both statistically and socially preferable.  \nRound 47: Choose A. A\u2019s 90% success and majority agreement dominate.  \nRound 48: Choose A. Same reasoning: choose A.  \nRound 49: Choose A. A remains best considering success and conformity.  \nRound 50: Choose A. Continue preferring A for expected reward plus the +1.  \nRound 51: Choose A. No benefit to deviating from majority A.  \nRound 52: Choose A. A\u2019s high EV and conformity keep it optimal.  \nRound 53: Choose A. Stick with the safe, majority-backed A.  \nRound 54: Choose A. A remains the sensible choice.  \nRound 55: Choose A. A\u2019s expected total (6+1) is far above B\u2019s (3-2).  \nRound 56: Choose A. Keep selecting A for the combined advantage.  \nRound 57: Choose A. A dominates by payoff and conformity.  \nRound 58: Choose A. Continue choosing A.  \nRound 59: Choose A. A still gives the best expected total.  \nRound 60: Choose A. End of first phase: A is clearly best.\n\nRound 61: Choose A. Now A\u2019s success drops to 50% (EV_A = 2) and B is 60% (EV_B = 3), but at round 61 the majority is still on A (B is chosen by 30%), so A gets +1 making A total 3 vs B total 1 \u2014 pick A.  \nRound 62: Choose A. Although B\u2019s raw EV is a bit higher, the majority still favors A so conformity makes A better overall.  \nRound 63: Choose A. Same: B\u2019s probability is higher, but majority alignment with A ( and the +1) yields higher total expected payoff.  \nRound 64: Choose A. Continue choosing A because the conformity bonus keeps it ahead.  \nRound 65: Choose A. Even with A=50% vs B=60%, the majority is still A, so A +1 beats B -2.  \nRound 66: Choose A. The majority still prefers A; conformity makes A optimal.  \nRound 67: Choose A. I pick A because agreeing with the majority offsets B\u2019s slightly better raw success.  \nRound 68: Choose A. A\u2019s lower raw EV is compensated by the +1 conformity bonus this round.  \nRound 69: Choose A. Continue with A while the majority remains with A.  \nRound 70: Choose A. Majority alignment keeps A preferred despite the switch in raw probabilities.  \nRound 71: Choose A. A remains the rational pick because of the conformity reward.  \nRound 72: Choose A. I stick with A since majority still favors it, so total for A > B.  \nRound 73: Choose A. The conformity incentive keeps A ahead of B this round.  \nRound 74: Choose A. A is chosen because the social bonus outweighs B\u2019s slightly higher success.  \nRound 75: Choose A. Continue following majority A for net expected gain.  \nRound 76: Choose A. I pick A \u2014 conformity +1 keeps A optimal.  \nRound 77: Choose A. Still better to agree with the group on A despite B\u2019s raw edge.  \nRound 78: Choose A. A remains the safer expected-total pick due to conformity.  \nRound 79: Choose A. The group is still mostly on A; the +1 conformity matters.  \nRound 80: Choose A. Continue choosing A because total expected value is higher when agreeing.  \nRound 81: Choose A. A +1 gives a total advantage over B -2.  \nRound 82: Choose A. I stick with A while it\u2019s still the majority choice.  \nRound 83: Choose A. This is the last round where A is still majority; conformity keeps A better overall.\n\nRound 84: Choose B. By round 84 the majority flips to B (B share \u2248 just over 50%), so now B gets +1 and A would incur -2. B\u2019s raw EV is 3 vs A\u2019s 2, and with conformity that gives B total \u22484 vs A total \u22480 \u2014 choose B.  \nRound 85: Choose B. With the majority on B and B\u2019s higher raw EV, B is clearly optimal (EV_B +1 > EV_A -2).  \nRound 86: Choose B. Now that the social norm favors B, picking B yields the highest expected return.  \nRound 87: Choose B. B\u2019s combination of better success probability and the conformity bonus makes it the right pick.  \nRound 88: Choose B. I pick B: higher raw EV plus the +1 majority bonus.  \nRound 89: Choose B. Continue with B while it is the majority and has higher EV.  \nRound 90: Choose B. B remains the rational choice both statistically and socially.  \nRound 91: Choose B. Stick with B \u2014 the net expected payoff is highest.  \nRound 92: Choose B. B\u2019s EV plus conformity makes it optimal.  \nRound 93: Choose B. Continue agreeing with the majority on B for best expected return.  \nRound 94: Choose B. B gives the best combined payoff.  \nRound 95: Choose B. I pick B since it\u2019s now the majority and has higher raw success probability.  \nRound 96: Choose B. B remains the best choice given probabilities and conformity incentives.  \nRound 97: Choose B. Choose B for higher expected total (EV_B +1).  \nRound 98: Choose B. Continue choosing B for expected gain and conformity.  \nRound 99: Choose B. B is optimal here; agree with the majority.  \nRound 100: Choose B.

B: 10(0.6)-3 = 3.\n- Since majority is still A in these rounds, A earns +1 conformity, B would be a disagree choice and lose 2.\n\n61. Round 61 \u2014 A. A: 2 + 1 = 3. B: 3 - 2 = 1.

Round 84 \u2014 B. A: 2 - 2 = 0 (disagree). B: 3 + 1 = 4 (agree). Pick B (4 vs 0).\n85. Round 85 \u2014 B. Same \u2192 pick B (4 vs 0).\n86. Round 86 \u2014 B. Same \u2192 pick B (4 vs 0).\n87.

The combination of A\u2019s outcome probability and the conformity bonus makes A the better expected choice.\n- Rounds 84\u2013100: switch to B. At that point the group majority favors B, giving B the conformity bonus and making B the higher expected payoff.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also:\n- Show the exact B-majority percentage I\u2019m assuming each round 61\u2013100 (I used a linear increase from 30% to 65% to determine when B crosses 50%), or\n- Recompute if you want a different model of how the majority shifts.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4460, "total_tokens": 4643, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2048, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

Round 1: Choose A. A\u2019s expected base payoff 6 vs B\u2019s 3, and majority favors A (+1 conformity), so A \u2248 7 vs B \u2248 1.\n2. Round 2: Choose A.

Base EV A = 2 vs B = 3, but majority still favors A (B only 30% initially), so A +1 \u2192 3 vs B -2 \u2192 1: pick A.\n62. Round 62: Choose A. Although A\u2019s base EV fell, the conformity bonus keeps A ahead.\n63. Round 63: Choose A. Effective EVs: A \u2248 3, B \u2248 1 while majority still A.\n64. Round 64: Choose A. Conformity + base EV makes A preferable through these rounds.\n65. Round 65: Choose A. A (2) +1 > B (3) -2, so A wins.\n66. Round 66: Choose A. Continue choosing A until the social signal flips.\n67. Round 67: Choose A. Conformity still favors A in this mid-phase.\n68. Round 68: Choose A. Effective expected payoff higher for A.\n69. Round 69: Choose A. A remains the better combined choice.\n70. Round 70: Choose A. Stick with A while the majority is still A.\n71. Round 71: Choose A. A\u2019s conformity advantage outweighs B\u2019s slight base EV edge.\n72. Round 72: Choose A.

Round 78: Choose A. Same numeric logic applies.\n79. Round 79: Choose A. A outperforms B once conformity is included.\n80. Round 80: Choose A. Continue with A.\n81. Round 81: Choose A. Majority hasn\u2019t flipped yet; A remains optimal.\n82. Round 82: Choose A. A\u2019s conformity bonus still in effect.\n83. Round 83: Choose A. Last round before the majority flips; A still the combined best choice.\n\nRounds 84\u2013100 (majority has shifted to B; still p(A)=0.50, p(B)=0.60)\n84. Round 84: Choose B. Now majority favors B, so B gets +1; B effective EV = 4 vs A = 0 \u2014 pick B.\n85. Round 85: Choose B. With conformity now rewarding B, B\u2019s combined payoff is highest.\n86. Round 86: Choose B. B\u2019s base EV plus the +1 conformity makes it clearly superior.\n87. Round 87: Choose B. A would incur a -2 conformity penalty and is much worse.\n88. Round 88: Choose B. B \u2248 4 expected vs A \u2248 0 \u2014 choose B.\n89. Round 89: Choose B. Conformity flips the advantage to B despite earlier preference for A.\n90. Round 90: Choose B. Continue picking B for maximum expected return.\n91. Round 91: Choose B. B is both statistically better and is the conforming choice now.\n92. Round 92: Choose B. Stick with B \u2014 expected payoff highest.\n93. Round 93: Choose B. B wins by combined EV and social bonus.\n94. Round 94: Choose B. No reason to deviate to A given the -2 conformity penalty.\n95. Round 95: Choose B. B remains optimal.\n96. Round 96: Choose B. Keep choosing B.\n97. Round 97: Choose B. B best choice in this final segment.\n98. Round 98: Choose B.

Below I explain the reasoning (button expected value + conformity bonus/penalty) and show why that choice is best. I group rounds with identical conditions but I indicate exactly which rounds are covered.\n\nBackground math I use each round:\n- Button expected payoff = 7*p_success + (-3)*(1 - p_success) = 10*p_success - 3.\n- Conformity: if I follow the majority I get +1; if I disagree I get -2.\n- Total expected value for a choice = button expected payoff + conformity adjustment.\n\nRounds 1\u201360 (rounds 1, 2, \u2026, 60)\n- Conditions: p(A)=0.90, p(B)=0.60. Majority = A (80%).\n- Button EVs: A = 10*0.90 - 3 = 6.0; B = 10*0.60 - 3 = 3.0.\n- With conformity: choose A (majority) \u2192 total EV = 6.0 + 1 = 7.0. Choose B (minority) \u2192 total EV = 3.0 - 2 = 1.0.\n- Decision each round: choose A. Reason: A is both much better in raw payoff (6 vs 3) and gives the conformity bonus if I follow the majority; the alternative loses conformity and is far worse.\n\nRounds 61\u201383 (rounds 61, 62, \u2026, 83)\n- Conditions: p(A) has dropped to 0.50, p(B)=0.60. However, the group\u2019s majority still favors A early in this window (the problem statement says B\u2019s share rises from 30% up to 65% over rounds 61\u2013100; linearly that means B doesn\u2019t become >50% until round 84). So in rounds 61\u201383 majority = A.\n- Button EVs: A = 10*0.50 - 3 = 2.0; B = 10*0.60 - 3 = 3.0.\n- With conformity: choose A (majority) \u2192 total EV = 2.0 + 1 = 3.0. Choose B (minority) \u2192 total EV = 3.0 - 2 = 1.0.\n- Decision each round: choose A. Reason: Even though B has a higher raw success EV (3.0 vs 2.0), the conformity bonus for A flips the combined expected value in favor of A (3.0 vs 1.0). So following the majority is still the better expected-return move.\n\nRound 84 (first round B becomes majority) and Rounds 84\u2013100 (rounds 84, 85, \u2026, 100)\n- Conditions: p(A)=0.50, p(B)=0.60. By the gradual shift described, B\u2019s share passes 50% at round 84, so for rounds 84\u2013100 majority = B.\n- Button EVs: A = 2.0; B = 3.0 (same raw numbers as above).\n- With conformity: choose B (new majority) \u2192 total EV = 3.0 + 1 = 4.0. Choose A (now minority) \u2192 total EV = 2.0 - 2 = 0.0.\n- Decision each round: choose B. Reason: Now B has both the higher raw payoff and the conformity bonus; choosing A would suffer both a lower raw payoff and a -2 conformity penalty, so B is clearly better.\n\nExpected score summary (expected points per round for my choices)\n- Rounds 1\u201360: expected +7.0 per round \u2192 60 * 7.0 = 420 expected points.\n- Rounds 61\u201383: expected +3.0 per round \u2192 23 * 3.0 = 69 expected points.\n- Rounds 84\u2013100: expected +4.0 per round \u2192 17 * 4.0 = 68 expected points.\n- Total expected points over 100 rounds \u2248 420 + 69 + 68 = 557.\n\nShort restatement by round range:\n- Rounds 1\u201360: pick A (A is clearly better, also majority).\n- Rounds 61\u201383: pick A (B\u2019s raw success is higher, but conformity bonus for A makes A better overall).\n- Rounds 84\u2013100: pick B (B becomes majority and already has the higher raw success, so it\u2019s best).\n\nIf you want, I can instead list a one-line natural explanation for each of the 100 rounds individually (so you have 100 separate lines), but the reasoning is identical within the ranges above.

After round 60 A's success rate drops, but for many rounds the group still favors A strongly enough that the conformity bonus keeps A the higher-expected pick until about round 83. Once the majority flips to B (around round 84), B becomes best both on success probability and by gaining the conformity +1, so I switch to B.", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 183, "completion_tokens": 4546, "total_tokens": 4729, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 2368, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}

B remains p=0.60 -> base EV_B = 3. So without conformity B is better. However the group's majority support for B increases gradually from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100.

Conformity flips the effective totals:\n\n- When majority is still A (rounds 61\u201383): A gets +1 => total A = 3; B would be disagreeing (-2) => total B = 1. So despite A having lower base, conformity makes A preferable.\n- When majority switches to B (rounds 84\u2013100): B gets +1 => total B = 4; A would be -2 => total A = 0.

So:\n  - A at 90% \u2192 EV = 10\u00b70.9 \u2212 3 = 6.\n  - B at 60% \u2192 EV = 10\u00b70.6 \u2212 3 = 3.\n  - A at 50% \u2192 EV = 10\u00b70.5 \u2212 3 = 2.\n- Conformity adjustment: agree with majority = +1; disagree = \u22122.\n- So when majority is A and A is 90% (rounds 1\u201360): A total EV = 6 + 1 = 7; B total EV = 3 \u2212 2 = 1 \u2192 choose A.\n- When A drops to 50% but majority still chooses A (rounds 61\u201383): A total EV = 2 + 1 = 3; B total EV = 3 \u2212 2 = 1 \u2192 still choose A.\n- The percent choosing B rises linearly from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100; it crosses 50% around round 84. From round 84 the majority is B, so:\n  - B total EV = 3 + 1 = 4; A total EV = 2 \u2212 2 = 0 \u2192 choose B.\n\nMore detailed per-round reasoning (grouped where identical)\n- Rounds 1\u201360 (each round): Choose A.\n  - Details: A success 90% \u2192 base EV 6.

A clearly better.\n- Rounds 61\u201383 (each round): Choose A.\n  - Details: A success now 50% \u2192 base EV 2; B stays 60% \u2192 base EV 3. Majority still favors A in this interval (B starts at 30% at round 61 and only crosses 50% later). Conformity makes A = 2+1 = 3, B = 3\u22122 = 1. So conforming to A is still the best expected outcome.\n- Rounds 84\u2013100 (each round): Choose B.\n  - Details: By round 84 the proportion choosing B has passed 50%, so B is the majority. B base EV 3 plus +1 conformity = 4; A base EV 2 but disagree \u22122 \u2192 0. So choose B.\n\nCheck of the majority switch timing\n- Percent choosing B increases from 30% at round 61 to 65% at round 100 (linear).
