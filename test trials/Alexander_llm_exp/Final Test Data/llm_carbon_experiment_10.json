I own a car and prefer the convenience and door-to-door travel when it’s also cheaper.\n\nRound 2 — Choose car. Fuel cost €60 equals the train fare. I’d likely drive here for flexibility (timing, luggage) unless I wanted to avoid driving that day; at parity I lean to the car.\n\nRound 3 — Choose train. Fuel €66 > train €60, so the train saves money. I’d take the train to cut costs and avoid extra wear on the car.\n\nRound 4 — Choose train. Fuel €72 is noticeably more expensive; the train is cheaper and easier given rising fuel costs.\n\nRound 5 — Choose train. Fuel €78 — I’d switch to the train to save money and because the price difference is significant.\n\nRound 6 — Choose train. Fuel €84 — still much more than €60, so train makes more financial sense.\n\nRound 7 — Choose train. Fuel €90 — same reasoning: cost savings and less stress driving.\n\nRound 8 — Choose train. Fuel €94 — I’d take the train; the car trip is substantially more expensive.\n\nRound 9 — Choose train. Fuel €100 — by now it’s clearly cheaper to travel by train and avoid high fuel costs and extra wear on the car."},

Fuel is cheaper for the trip and I value the door-to-door convenience and carrying any luggage; since it’s cheaper, I’d drive.\n\nRound 2 — Fuel €60 vs Train €60: Choose car. Costs are equal, but owning a car and wanting flexibility (timing, door-to-door, no transfers) tips me to drive.\n\nRound 3 — Fuel €66 vs Train €60: Choose train. Train is cheaper and I’d prefer not to pay extra for petrol; also I can relax/ work on the train.\n\nRound 4 — Fuel €72 vs Train €60: Choose train. Higher fuel cost makes the train clearly the better economic choice, and it’s more relaxing.\n\nRound 5 — Fuel €78 vs Train €60: Choose train. Substantially more expensive to drive; I’d take the train.\n\nRound 6 — Fuel €84 vs Train €60: Choose train. Too costly to drive compared with the train fare.\n\nRound 7 — Fuel €90 vs Train €60: Choose train. Train saves a lot of money; I’d take it.\n\nRound 8 — Fuel €94 vs Train €60: Choose train. Driving is much more expensive; I’d go by train.\n\nRound 9 — Fuel €100 vs Train €60: Choose train. No question — the train is far cheaper and preferable given the cost difference."},
