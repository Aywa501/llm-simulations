For one-issue situations, the optimal mechanism neither achieves full efficiency nor is strategy-proof. However, for disputes involving two issues, an efficient and strategy-proof mechanism can be achieved within a confined parameter set. Within subjects, we vary whether these parameters allow for strategy-proofness in two-issue scenarios. Between subjects, we vary the ODR mechanisms, differentiating between direct and sequential formats. Free-form bargaining serves as our reference baseline.",

    "Experimental Design": " There are 30 participants in the experiment in each session, split into two groups of 15 for the whole experiment.\r The experiment consists of 20 rounds. Only one round is payoff relevant. At the beginning of each round, all participants of each group are randomly matched in pairs. Participants know they are matched with a new random participant from the group of 15 every round.\r In each round, there are 100 items of type A and 100 items of type B to split. \rFor type A, participants have outside options, i.e., the number of items of type A they will receive in the case of bargaining failure. Subjects know that the outside options vi could be any number between 0 and 100 with equal probability and are drawn independently for each subject.\r The outside options for the type B object are equal to 0 for both subjects, and they know it. However, each subject has a different multiplier for the points of type B. Multiplier is drawn independently for each subject from the uniform distribution between [0.7,1.3]. Subjects know their multiplier for the round and the distribution. \r Finally, the market could either with or without deal-breaking for type A items. In markets with deal-breaking, subjects receive zero points if they end up with fewer A type items than their outside option. Subjects know that the presence of a deal-breaking property is the same for all subjects in the round. The utility function for each round is presented. To simplify the setup, subjects will play the first ten rounds under no deal-breaking, followed by 10 rounds of deal-breaking, or in the reversed order. We will balance the order. We will remind subjects of the switch in the utility function after round 10.\r This corresponds to no information treatment of Bochet et al. 2023.\r Under this parametrization, in expectation, 28% of markets have a surplus large enough to reach efficiency even in one-dimensional bargaining (the sum of outside options is less than 75). 22% of the markets have a small surplus and cannot reach an agreement despite a positive surplus from bargaining (the sum of outside options is between 75 and 100). 50% of the markets have no surplus, as the sum of outside values is higher than 100. This implies that, in expectation, we will have 22 hard markets\r  The deal-breaking property affects the utility function of subjects. Under no deal-breaking, a subject’s payoff for the round is\r U_i=A_i+w_i*B_i\rwhere A_i is agreed amount of type A items or v_i if agreement is not reached. B_i is agreed amount of the type B item or 0 is agreement is not reached.\r   Under deal-breaking a subject’s payoff for the round is\rU_i=A_i+w_i*B_i  if A_i≥v_i, or  0 if A_i&lt;v_i \rwhere A_i is agreed amount of type A items or v_i if agreement is not reached. B_i is agreed amount of the type B item or 0 if agreement is not reached. Thus, accepting an offer of type A item below outside option leads to zero payoff from type A items.\r The points collected in U are transformed in euros with exchange rate of 10 cents per 1 point.\r   Treatments.\rWe have 3x2 between-subject design.\r \t                                                        One issue\tTwo issues\rFree bargaining (Barg).

    "Abstract": "A large literature examines performance pay for managers in the private sector, but little is known about performance pay for managers in public sector bureaucracies. In this paper, researchers study performance incentives rewarding school administrators for reducing anemia among their students. This study is part of a larger randomized control trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” which was implemented in Northwest China. The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. It was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five performance incentive arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \r The study discussed in this paper focuses only Arms 1, 2, and 3. Randomly assigning 170 schools to three performance incentive levels and two orthogonal sizes of unconditional grants, researchers analyze performance pay and its complementarity with discretionary resources. They find that both large incentives and larger unconditional grants reduced anemia substantially, but incentives were more cost-effective. Performance incentives led administrators to innovate by working with parents, mitigating potentially offsetting compensatory behavior among households. Researchers also find that larger unconditional grants completely crowded-out the effect of incentives. Their findings suggest that performance incentives can be effective in bureaucratic environments – but also that discretionary resources can fully crowd-out their effect.\r The remaining 130 of 300 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M. (2015). “Multiple Tasks and Multiple Rewards: Experimental Evidence on Performance Incentives, Alignment and Complementarity from Chinese Schools.” Working paper).\r Note, the original trial was registered on October 12, 2012 in the J-Pal Hypothesis Registry because the AEA RCT Registry did not exist at that time (https://www.povertyactionlab.org/Hypothesis-Registry).\r",

    "Intervention(s)": "This study is part of a larger randomized control trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China,” which was implemented in Northwest China and was designed to test outcome-based performance pay based on school-level anemia prevalence given to school principals as a means of improving the effectiveness of school-based anemia reduction programs, including how performance pay based on anemia prevalence compares to more traditional rewards based on student exam scores, how the two types of rewards affect student achievement, and the complementarity of the two types of rewards in their effects on anemia rates and academic performance, as well as how results varied by the size of incentives provided. The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The experiment was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five treatment arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Within each of these groups, half were assigned to receive a small subsidy and half a large subsidy.\r This part of the study includes 170 schools assigned to Arms 1, 2, and 3. Once schools were allocated to one of these treatment arms, the principal of each school receiving a small incentive, a large incentive, or no incentive for reducing anemia prevalence in their schools.\r Comparison group: In 65 schools, principals did not receive any incentive to reduce anemia; they received only budget support and information. (Arm 1 of the original trial)\r Large performance incentives: In 65 schools, principals received a larger incentive of 125 yuan (US$20) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. Under this incentive structure, it was feasible for principals in this group to earn incentives equivalent to two additional months of salary. (Arm 2 of the original trial)\r Small performance incentives: In 40 schools, principals received 12.5 Chinese yuan (US$2) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. (Arm 3 of the original trial)\r Across each of the three incentive groups, all schools were randomly assigned to receive small or large black grants in order to examine the effect of different amounts of resources on the prevalence of anemia. Although these funds were given in the context of the nutrition program, principals were free to reallocate them to other school functions, and receiving these funds did not depend on reducing anemia prevalence.",

    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "",
    "Experimental Design": "This study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” In the original trial, researchers began with 36 counties officially designated by the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province, and Ankang in Shaanxi Province). In August 2011, researchers conducted a canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the number of students enrolled in each. Restricting the sampling frame to primary schools with 150-300 students total, they randomly selected 300 of 1,410 eligible schools for inclusion in the study (and limited selection to one school per township). The sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools in the same region of China. Within study schools, researchers randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students from each school (10-to-11-year-old students). Researchers chose these grades to select students sufficiently old to provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent. Researchers conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at baseline to obfuscate the focus on fourth and fifth graders.\r The original experiment was designed as a cluster-randomized trial using a 5x2 crosscutting design. After conducting the baseline survey, researchers provided all school administrators with information about anemia, and schools were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental cells. The five incentive groups arms were: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). The planned methodology and specifications for analyzing the impacts of the program are outlined in the Pre-Analysis Plan. Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \r This part of the study includes only Arm 1, referred to as Group A: a group without incentives; Arm 2, referred to as Group C: a “large” incentive group; and Arm 3, referred to as Group B: a “small” incentive group. As noted, each of these arms has two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group (Group 1: 85 schools; Group A1: 32 schools; Group B1: 20 schools; Group C1: 33 schools) and a “large” block grant group (Group 2: 85 schools; Group A2: 33 schools; Group B2: 20 schools; Group C2: 32 schools). The reference group is the default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no incentives, Group A1). To improve power, researches used stratified randomization. Using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, researchers randomized cell assignment within each stratum. This analysis takes this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects. \r In the large incentive group - Group C - researchers offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between the beginning and end of the school year, with 125 yuan (RMB) ($19.40) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., two months of a school administrator’s annual salary for a 50-percent reduction in anemia). Researchers did not reveal the identity of anemic students. The small incentive group - Group B - was identical to the Group C except that the incentive was 12.5 RMB ($1.95) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., 0.2 additional months of annual salary for 50-percent reduction in anemia). When school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (student identity was not revealed). Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the contract, one of which they kept). All interventions were implemented in partnership with local education bureaus, signaling that the project was sanctioned by local governments.\r The small block grant group - Group 1 - was 0.3 RMB ($0.05) per student per day for school administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant  - Group 2 - was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day. In total, Group 1 schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and Group 2 schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two installments (at the beginning of the program and half way through the school year). Although funds were given in the context of nutrition, administrators were free to allocate these to other school functions at their discretion.\r Prior to revealing treatment assignment, researchers provided health education about nutrition and anemia to all school administrators in the study. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011 and follow-up survey in May 2012 (i.e., at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed information on students, households, school administrators, and schools. As part of Student Surveys, researchers interviewed all sampled students at their schools, collecting information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities, and general health. Students were given standard food frequency questionnaires to collect information about food consumption at school and at home over the past week. Researchers measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site (at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems. As part of Household Surveys, for each sampled student, researchers collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be unlikely to know themselves. As part of School Administrator Surveys, researchers interviewed school administrators (bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Researchers also measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding of the training material. Through School Surveys, researchers collected basic information from schools (enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (teacher characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).\r For primary outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), researchers test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their interactions and three additional ones – that the small and large incentives have the same average effect, that the large incentive and the large block grant have the same average effect, and that the average effect of the large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero. Therefore researchers adjust p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993), which accounts for the dependency of the data. For secondary outcomes, researchers adjust p-values according to the total number of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five – the number of treatment coefficients in each regression). Secondary outcomes are behavioral responses underlying changes in primary outcomes (actions taken by administrators (provision of supplements or food and communication with households) and subsequent responses among students and their parents (student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its nutritional basis).\r Finally, researchers examine the cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination, considering both the sub-sample of children anemic at baseline and the full sample of children, and present both “programmatic” cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and social cost-effectiveness calculations. Researchers calculate total social costs as the sum of programmatic costs, the cost of public funds, and costs incurred by households in response to the interventions. \r As noted earlier, the full experiment involved 300 schools. The remaining 130 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M. (2015). “Multiple Tasks and Multiple Rewards: Experimental Evidence on Performance Incentives, Alignment and Complementarity from Chinese Schools.” Working paper).",

    "Intervention(s)": "We implement an encouragement design in order to estimate the impact of the Subvencion Escolar Preferencial (SEP), a targeted voucher that allows low-income parents to attend private voucher schools with copayment for free. Therefore, we randomize two treatments that are meant to inform parents about the SEP and the wider range of educational options that they can access thanks to the program. \r The first treatment is the provision of a report card designed for each preschool that includes information about the SEP and a list with all the secondary schools located in the same neighborhood, their addresses, telephone numbers and a map with their locations. In order to reinforce the idea that the SEP increases educational options for low socioeconomic parents, the schools' list is divided in three groups \"schools that are free for anyone\" , \"schools that are free for SEP students\" and \"schools that charge fees\" . The objective is to strengthen the idea that SEP students can now attend “schools that are free for SEP students” without paying.\r The second treatment is the provision of the same report card, but it includes extra information on schools' characteristics: (i) test scores, (ii)a measure of the change in test scores between years, (iii) the official tuition cost for SEP and non SEP parents, (iv) the type of school (i.e. whether it is public or private) and (v) weather it has preschool and high school.\r Parents in the control group are also given a report card that includes a flyer highlighting the importance of choosing the right school for their children and a list with all the secondary schools in their neighborhood, their addresses, telephone numbers and a map with their locations. The objective of this report card is to act as a placebo. ",

While prior research has extensively examined the role of mobile technologies in improving educational outcomes, the specific pathways through which low-tech distance education interventions foster women's digital inclusion and empowerment remain insufficiently explored. This research assesses whether the intervention has contributed to enhancements in mothers’ digital literacy, autonomy, economic empowerment, perceptions of gender roles, and their children's educational achievements and aspirations. The study anticipates that the intervention will strengthen mothers’ connectivity and agency, with findings expected to offer critical insights into how accessible technology and parent-led distance education initiatives can promote digital inclusion, connectivity, empowerment, and agency among rural women.",

The audio lessons featured pre-recorded conversations among four characters: two teachers and two students. During the conversations, students were asked to do some activities according to the teachers’ instructions, such as clapping, standing up, counting, and making plans. The teachers used regular pauses and cues, as well as playing music and songs during the recorded lessons to assist the children in completing similar tasks with the help of their mothers.

We will assess whether this intervention enhances women’s connectivity over time, agency, gender attitude and leading to increased empowerment. The primary outcomes are - \r Digital Connectivity: The Digital Connectivity will quantify the extent of household access to digital technologies among rural Bangladeshi mothers, reflecting their potential for digital engagement in low-resource settings.\r Agency: By following Kabeer (1999), we conceptualize mothers’ agency through a process through which the mothers make strategic decisions, exert control over their material, human and social resources, and move with freedom, particularly in ways related to their children’s education and their digital connectivity, which is largely restricted by several socio-cultural norms in Bangladeshi society. \r Gender Attitude Index (GAI): Gender Attitude Index (GAI), an indicator of social norm, will be measured following the method outlined by Dhar et al. (2022). It is designed to capture attitudes towards gender roles, embracing the conception of equality and the more patriarchal concept. \r Digital Literacy Transfer Index (DLTI): Digital Literacy Transfer Index measures the degree to which mothers introduce newly acquired digital competencies to other family members, particularly children, focusing on their behavioral shifts and role as agents of new technologies within households. \r Economic Empowerment: Economic Empowerment will be measured in light of the Five Domains of Empowerment (5DE) framework from the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which assesses empowerment across five key domains: Production, Resources, Income, Leadership, and Time.",

    "Secondary Outcomes (end points)": "Children’s educational status: Educational status of the children will be measured to identify whether there is any gender heterogeneity after receiving tech-based distance learning in the long run.

These questions will explore the amount of time mothers invest in teaching their children at home, the types of educational activities they engage in, the frequency and duration of these activities. \r Educational Aspirations for Children: Educational aspirations will be assessed based on the academic and professional goals that mothers establish for their children, in accordance with theoretical frameworks on maternal education’s influence on child development (Behrman et al., 1999) and sociocultural factors shaping parental aspirations (Yamamoto and Holloway, 2010).",

    "Experimental Design": "We will use original sampling design where 90 villages were randomly selected from a list of 140 villages (out of 223 villages from ECD program) and each of the 90 participating villages randomly distributed into one of three groups, i.e., Standard group, Extended group, and Control group (Wang et al., 2024). However, for this study, we merged these two treatment groups into one as mothers from both treatment groups received similar intervention.",
    "Experimental Design Details": "Study participants: Participants of the IVR program by Wang et al. (2024) were recruited in early 2021 from a list of households previously involved in Global Development &amp; Research Initiative Foundation (GDRI)’s pre-pandemic early childhood development project (hereinafter, ECD program). ECD program introduces and evaluates alternative models of early childhood interventions—traditional kindergarten and home visits—that can be effectively scaled for implementation. A large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in rural communities to assess the efficacy of three approaches: a preschool program, the program combined with a parent academy, and the program integrated with home visits. The first intervention established a preschool program, the second included weekly home visits by teachers or caregivers to facilitate parent-child interactions and enhance the home learning environment, and the third combined the preschool program with home visits. The research involved around 7,000 children from 223 villages in southwestern Bangladesh. ECD program’s endline was completed in early 2019. Many children who were involved in ECD program were in primary school in early 2021, making them suitable candidates for IVR intervention.\r Participant recruitment process: In early 2021, a subsample of villages for IVR intervention were identified from 223 villages with prior participation in ECD program. GDRI, as the partner organization for IVR program, provided this village list. Crucially, GDRI was instructed to restrict the list of eligible households in these villages that: (a) had active phone numbers and 1-4 graders; (b) were initially willing to participate; and (c) were not involved in any interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to budget constraints, 90 villages were selected and then randomized into one of two treatments (i.e., Standard and Extended treatments) and a control group. Anticipating potential attrition, a rapid baseline survey was conducted for approximately 2,400 eligible participants. Within each village, eligible households were randomly selected. This step narrowed the sample down to approximately 1,900 households. Some further attrition occurred after before the intervention began. The final sample included 596 participants in the Standard treatment group, 586 in the Extended treatment group, and 581 in the control group. ",

    "Abstract": "Physical inactivity is one of the four major risk factors for non-communicable diseases (WHO 2016). Decisions about engaging in physical activity involve making trade-offs between immediate costs and future benefits suggesting that time preference (how present or future oriented an individual is) and present bias (the enhanced significance an individual attaches to immediate outcomes) may play a part in how these decisions are made. Despite demonstrated correlational associations between physical activity and time preference and present bias, to date, time preference and present bias have not been taken into account when designing interventions to increase physical activity.  Within economics the quasi-hyperbolic model (Laibson 1997)  is currently used to model such intertemporal decision making. From examining the quasi-hyperbolic model it can be seen that the individual’s decision to engage in physical activity depends on the temporally proximal costs and the temporally distant benefits of that activity, how much they discount the temporally distant benefits and how present biased they are when the time to be active becomes immediate. This suggests that an effective intervention should aim to increase the salience of future benefits and counteract present bias. Increasing the salience of temporally distant benefits might be achieved by getting the individual to consider the future consequences of their actions and connect to their future-self. Present bias is often assumed to involve temptation and self-control. Commitment contracts (paying a forfeit for failing to follow through with plans) are often regarded as a method of overcoming temptation and therefore counteracting present bias. This leads to the conclusion that an effective intervention could aim to (a) increase the salience of temporally distant benefits of activity by considering future consequences of current inactivity and connecting to one’s future-self and (b) counteract the temptation component of present bias by applying commitment. This study seeks to develop, and then test the effectiveness of one such intervention which has the potential to be inexpensive and easy to administer and could therefore provide a valuable addition to measures being used to counteract the physical inactivity crisis.",

This intervention combines the Consideration and Connection intervention with the Commitment task.",
    "Intervention (Hidden)": "Consideration &amp; Connection\rThe Consideration &amp; Connection element is designed to increase the salience of an individual’s beliefs about the future benefits of physical activity and to improve their connection to their future-self. Participants are first provided with information on the long-term consequences of being inactive and the long-term benefits of physical activity. Participants are then asked to imagine themselves 10 to 15 years in the future if they continue at their current levels of inactivity. They are asked to write about their appearance, general health, relationships, lifestyle and feelings. This visualisation technique is based on one initially used by Oullete (2005) and later by Murru et al (2010), Perras et al (2016) and Strachan et al (2017).\rFollowing that participants receive a personalised, progressive walking plan with daily targets for each week of the eight week plan (see study procedure section for details). These targets will be based on their baseline step count and are aimed at increasing their weekly step count to at least 15000 steps per week by the end of first 4 weeks. The second 4 weeks consist of a maintenance phase of attempting to achieve at least 15000 steps per week.\rFor the duration of the intervention period (the first four weeks) participants will be asked on a weekly basis to review the image they generated of their future-self and what they feel the consequences of their current week’s activity levels will be for that future-self.\rConsideration &amp;Connection &amp;Commitment Group (C&amp;C&amp;C)\rThis intervention combines the Consideration and Connection intervention (described above) with the Commitment task. Commitment is designed to overcome the temptations of activities that are currently more pleasant (such as sitting on the sofa) but ultimately less beneficial than others that involve higher current costs (such as going to the gym). It normally involves the individual voluntarily agreeing to pay a forfeit (often to charity) if they fail to achieve their goal. The principle will be explained to the participants and they will be directed to the stickK.com website if they decide to make a commitment. (StickK.com has been used in other research about physical activity (Goldhaber-Fiebert, Blumenkranz et al. 2010). It was created by a trio of Yale Scholars (Ian Ayres, Jordan Goldberg and Dean Karlan) and is based on research in the field of commitment (Ashraf, Karlan et al. 2006).) Once they have registered with the website the participants can set up their step goals according to the personalised walking plan for each of the four weeks of the intervention period, decide upon their weekly forfeit and also on who will receive that forfeit should they fail. They will have the opportunity to set up a referee (someone who verifies that they have achieved their weekly goal). In this manner the commitment part of the study can be made real without the study being involved in any handling of monies.\rControl Group\rThe control group will receive the personalised walking plan only.\r",

    "Experimental Design Details": "The trial will be run online through a Qualtrics interface. The recruitment literature will have a link to this interface and interested individuals will be able to access the website. \rInformation, Consent and Eligibility\rOnce participants have accessed the initial section of the Qualtrics interface they will be given more information on the study and then be asked to give consent.  Following on from this eligibility will be ascertained by answering self-report questions. Activity levels will be derived from answering questions adapted from the short self-administered form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (https://sites.google.com/site/theipaq/). Vigorous minutes will be multiplied by two to give moderate minutes. Participants will be ineligible if they are typically active for more than 70 minutes per week. Participants will also be asked how old they are, whether they are already taking part in a physical activity program, whether they are willing and able to undertake a walking plan and whether they are able to send and receive email messages. They will also be asked if they know of any other reason why they should not engage in physical activity.\rThe interface will terminate with a suitable thank you message at this point for ineligible participants and no data will be retained.\rThe Qualtrics interface will trigger a notification email for study administration purposes at this point for all eligible participants who complete the initial survey.\rRandomisation and Blinding\rOnce consent has been given and eligibility has been established participants will be randomised to one of the three groups (Control, Consideration &amp; Connection and Consideration &amp; Connection &amp; Commitment) through a Qualtrics computer generated sequence.\rIt will not be possible to carry out full blinding of the participants as those who receive the intervention will be aware of the contents of the intervention. As it is essentially a trial run by one person it will also be difficult to blind the researcher about the assignments to the various groups.\rBaseline Measurement\rAfter randomisation participants will be issued with an activity pack that contains a pedometer, instructions on how to operate the pedometer, instructions about how to record baseline activity and a diary for recording baseline step counts (see appendix).\rBaseline will be assessed by instructing the participant to wear the pedometer all day (not just when they go for a walk), every day for one week. The participant will record the step count from each of those days in the diary. They will then report these values as part of the main data collection. \rMain Trial Period\rOnce participants have complete the procedure of taking baseline activity measures they will return to the interface to report their baseline activity. At this stage they will be asked to complete various questions relating to the outcome measures required. After that those randomised to the Consideration &amp; Connection and Consideration &amp; Connection &amp; Commitment groups will perform various intervention tasks (see appendix).\rThe Qualtrics system will trigger an email to a study administration with details of the participant and their baseline step count. This will allow a personalised walking plan to be produced.\rThe personalised, progressive walking plan will then be posted to the participant (see appendix). Those in the Consideration &amp; Connection &amp; Commitment group will also receive instructions about accessing stickK.com (see appendix).  The walking plan will consist of daily targets for each week. These targets will be based upon their baseline step count and aimed at increasing their weekly step count to at least 15000 steps per week by the end of the intervention period (4 weeks). (For the first week their daily target will be average daily baseline step count (adbs) + 750 steps; for week two adbs + 1500 steps and for week three and four adbs + 2250 steps.) The final four weeks of the plan will consist of a maintenance phase of attempting to achieve at least 15000 steps per week. (i.e. adbs + at least 2250 steps).\rThe rationale behind aiming for this increase over baseline  is that walking at least 15000 steps per week would bring the participant into line with the recommended minimum guidelines of 150 minutes (on the assumption that 3000 steps equate to 30 minutes (Marshall, Levy et al. 2009)) of moderate exercise a week (UK Government 2011).\rDuring the intervention period (four weeks) participants will report daily step counts on a weekly basis through Qualtrics. Those in the Consideration &amp; Connection group and the Consideration &amp; Connection &amp; Commitment group will also review the effect on their future-selves of their current week’s activity levels.\rAt the end of the intervention period (four weeks) and again at the end of the maintenance phase (a further four weeks) participants will be administered physical activity report questions based on the short self-report IPAQ questionnaire (https://sites.google.com/site/theipaq/).\rAt the end of the study) participants will report step counts, complete follow up repeat measures and be asked follow up qualitative questions through the Qualtrics interface. The purpose of the responses in the free text boxes is to provide further information to inform the discussion of the results of the research. If step count reporting has been incomplete the follow up questionnaire will be distributed once the remaining duration of the walking plan has elapsed.\rParticipants will be sent one prompt and two reminder emails via the Qualtrics interface at each stage of the study. Confirmation of posting emails will be sent once the activity and diary packs have been posted. Participants will receive an Amazon voucher for £15 on completion of the final follow-up questionnaire. Participants will be allowed to retain the pedometers. These strategies are intended to maximise retention rates, data gathering and adherence to the intervention protocol.\r",

Beneficiaries engage in public works (PW) program or if they are unable to work, they receive an unconditional direct support transfer (DS).  \r This document outlines the pre-analysis plan to study the effects of the UPSNP in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, one year after it started. The evaluation takes advantage of the randomization of the program at the woreda (urban district) level during its first year of implementation. Of the 90 eligible woredas in Addis, 35 were randomly assigned to start implementation right away (in year 1) while the remaining 55 were assigned to start implementation approximately 12 months later (in year 2). \r We study the effect of the program on household welfare, labour supply, and attitudes towards gender norms and welfare recipients. We do so by comparing households enrolled in the program in areas randomly selected to receive the program in year 1 to households enrolled in the program when it is rolled out in control neighbourhoods in year 2. \r With this study we aim to learn about key questions about the effects of public works programs. Among other things, we ask the following questions: First, what are the effects of public works on non-public works labour supply in urban contexts where labour markets are largely unaffected by seasonality? Second, if the program leads women who have not worked before, how does participation in public works affect gender norms around women's decisions to work? Third, do urban public works programs lead to noticeable improvements in public goods in local neighbourhoods, along the intended dimensions of the work activities? Fourth, how does the arrival of a comprehensive social safety net program in urban areas affect households attitudes to welfare programs and the state? \r",

    "Abstract": "Bayesian Updating is the dominant theory of learning in economics and other disciplines. According to this theory, decision-makers have prior beliefs which they update according to Bayes rule after receiving new information. The theory is silent about how individuals react to receiving information that the subjects have not observed previously and, hence, which they may deem impossible. Recent theoretical literature has put forth a possible mechanism, called “reverse Bayesianism”, which decision-makers may use to react to unforeseen events. However, these and other possible mechanisms have not been experimentally tested. The project will fill this large gap in the literature by running a series of economic experiments. First, the experimental subjects will be asked to virtually and repeatedly draw balls from an urn. This will allow them to form beliefs about the proportion of different prizes in the urn. Subsequently, they will repeatedly bet on various prizes drawn from the urn. The subjects’ beliefs about the composition of the urn will also be elicited. The composition of the urn will be changed midpoint during this sequence (by adding a new prize that wasn’t originally present in the urn) so that the experimental subjects subsequently observe events that couldn’t be predicted given their prior information. We will explore how this will change their betting behaviour and their beliefs about the composition of the urn. We will also address the following questions. Do individuals naturally expect events that were previously considered impossible? Do individuals learn to expect what is previously considered impossible? Do individuals attach a positive or negative value to the consequences of such events?\r ",

These elicitations are incentivised by using methods similar to Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM)  to report the subjective probability of prizes and their willingness to accept to sell the lotteries (see the enclosed documents for more details).\r There are two main treatments: \r In the control treatment:  Subjects observe 20 draws from a urn containing 50 prizes of 100 experimental units and 50 prizes of 20 Experimental units and they are explicitly told that they urn contains two and only two prizes. They need to report the subjective probabilities of the two prizes and their willingness to accept for selling the lottery determined by a random draw from the urn.\r In the surprise treatment:  Subjects observe 20 draws from a urn -- that we call \"original urn\" containing 50 prizes of 100 experimental units and 50 prizes of 20 Experimental units. They are asked to report the subjective probabilities of the two prizes and their willingness to accept for selling the lottery determined by a random draw from the original urn. Then we add to the original urn -- that we call now \"updated\" urn -- 50 prizes of E experimental units and we ask subjects to observe a new draw from the updated urn. This is a non random draw featuring the prize E. Subjects after observing E, and without other information are asked again to report the subjective probabilities of the two prizes and their willingness to accept for selling the lottery determined by a random draw from the modified urn.\r In the surprise treatment we further distinguish two different sub-treatments one where the prizes added is E = 200 units - the good surprise treatment; and the other where the prizes added is E = 10 units - the bad surprise treatment. \r We plan to run this experiment online by using the Amazon MTurk platform",

Using data collected through facility and mystery client surveys, we estimated impacts on multiple healthcare and financial outcomes. Treated facilities increased the range of contraceptive methods offered by 10.2 percent relative to control facilities. Assignment to treatment also increased the overall quality of a provider's counseling services, interpersonal skills, and overall knowledge.

The providers then decided which training sessions, if any, their staff would participate in.  Supportive supervision services, and other complementary services were also offered.\r2) Control: Private health providers were not offered any elements of the training package or complimentary services.\r Since each private health provider independently chose which training sessions and complimentary services to take advantage of, our analysis employs an “intent-to-treat” approach to examine the impact of offering the multi-faceted intervention, regardless of participation in the training sessions.",

We randomly assigned those 965 private health facilities into either a treatment group (484 facilities) or a control group (481 facilities) using the following steps for stratification: First, we created strata for each of the 20 local government areas, or LGA, creating 20 “primary cells.” We made sure that each cell contained at least four facilities in order to avoid sparsely populated cells. Second, we created sub-strata. This was done as follows. For primary cells with more than 16 facilities, we created sub-strata by splitting the primary strata into those above and below the median vignette score  (defined below) and, within each of the resulting sub-strata, splitting again into those above and below the median business score .  Thus, we created “final cells,” which were groupings of facilities from the same LGA and, if the sample size permitted, were also similar in terms of the vignette score and business score.  Finally, we randomly assigned all 965 facilities, one by one within each of those ‘final cells’ to either a control or treatment group.",

For these power calculations, we set alpha (the probability of type I error) to .05 and power to .8, and estimated that 75 percent of facilities in the treatment group would attend at least one of the training sessions (it ended up being 85 percent, slightly improving our power relative to our calculations).

    "Abstract": "Unemployment has been a persistent issue in Egypt, particularly among women. This study aims to explore the role of parental pressure on the labor market outcomes of young adults, with a specific focus on how gender dynamics influence these outcomes. The study will involve conducting a census in the target governorates. In each village, the data collection team will begin by gathering information on available jobs within the village, district, and governorate. Based on the data collected during interviews, enumerators will offer jobs to job seekers that match their interests, qualifications, and ability to work within and outside the villages. The study investigates the impact of parental pressure on the labor market outcomes of young adults in Egypt with a focus on the differences in effects based on gender and parental role. \rThis design will help estimate the impact of parental involvement on youth labor market outcomes, with particular attention to gender differences in parental pressure. The involvement of parents and jobs will be randomized between the different randomized groups over a sample of more than 8000 job seekers in Egypt\r",

    "Intervention(s)": "In our experiment, we aimed to address all these challenges comprehensively. To begin, we tackled the issue of job suitability by collecting job opportunities at the village, district, and governorate levels. These jobs were then classified into different categories. Next, we gathered data from job seekers and their parents to match their needs, qualifications, and interests with suitable job opportunities. The objective of this step was to provide tailored job matches while addressing information barriers as effectively as possible.\rBy offering these job opportunities at the household level, we sought to mitigate additional challenges such as financial barriers, uncertainty about the jobs, and the risk of sexual harassment during transportation. Collecting data separately from youth and their parents allowed us to identify any gaps in expectations regarding the types of jobs and the associated requirements for youth versus their parents.\rSubsequently, we presented job opportunities to the youth in stages: first to the youth alone, then in the presence of their fathers, and finally in the presence of their mothers. This approach enabled us to explore the role of parental involvement in the decision-making process and its impact on job acceptance.

The objective was to compare the outcomes of offering jobs to youth alone, offering jobs to youth along with their fathers, and offering jobs to youth along with their mothers.

We investigate how self-esteem influences the demand for social status: are self-esteem and social image complements or substitute? We consider premium credit cards, which can be demanded not only for the services and benefits that they provide, but also for social image motives. Since qualification requirements for these cards are usually high, this is a financial product generally available only to wealthy individuals. This exclusivity makes it a well-know symbol of success, which might enhance the owner's social image. We design a phone marketing experiment which has two purposes: first, to temporarily give a boost to the self-esteem of some customers; and second, to disentangle the role of social image considerations and instrumental benefits in explaining the demand for a platinum card.",

    "Intervention(s)": "We design a phone marketing experiment in which we randomize the characteristics of the product being offered and the scripts used for the call.\rFirst, some clients are offered to replace their non-premium card by a premium card, while others are offered all of the extra services of a premium card on their existing non-premium card. Customers will thus be offered the same instrumental services: the only thing differing is whether the services are included in their present relatively nondescript card, or on the premium card which might have an additional \"social status\" component. If the share accepting the premium card is higher than the share accepting the added benefits to the non-premium card, we will have established that customers value the status associated with the exclusive premium card. \rTo understand what drives the demand for social status, we interact this treatment with a second one. Before being made the offer, customers in a control group are asked to name their favorite TV channel, while customers in a treatment group are asked to describe an event in their life that made them feel successful. According to the literature in psychology, this treatment can (at least temporarily) increase the self-esteem of the customers. We will thus be able to analyze whether the demand for social status is higher (lower) among customers with higher self-esteem, and thus understand whether self-image and social-image are complements or substitutes.",

There is an urgent need for policy tools that can assist households in coping with these events. Anticipatory humanitarian action is a novel approach where humanitarian organizations use meteorological forecasts to proactively distribute humanitarian assistance to households before disasters occur. This anticipatory distribution of assistance aims to prevent or reduce humanitarian impacts before they fully unfold. This study conducts a randomized impact evaluation of anticipatory cash transfers distributed to pastoralist households in Mongolia, where extreme winter conditions cause high livestock mortality and threaten rural livelihoods. We evaluate the effectiveness of cash transfers with an average value of 236 USD to at-risk households amid the extremely severe winter of 2020/21. Specifically, we investigate whether the receipt of one-off cash transfers helped pastoralist households prevent socioeconomic damage by considering their effects on households’ assets, income, investments, and consumption.",

    "Intervention(s)": "Large parts of the rural population in Mongolia rely on livestock herding for their livelihood. In recent years, harsh winter conditions have led to substantial livestock mortality and significantly impacted exposed pastoralists’ socioeconomic well-being. In reaction, steps towards an early warning system have been undertaken. Since 2015, Mongolia’s Information and Research Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology, and Environment (IRIMHE) has released geographic risk projections for extreme winter conditions during the early winter. These risk maps are utilized as a trigger in several anticipatory humanitarian assistance programs implemented by international organizations, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and FAO. As soon as a pre-determined risk level is reached, humanitarian assistance is disbursed to at-risk households to prevent or reduce acute humanitarian impacts before they fully materialize. The early distribution is intended to make humanitarian assistance more effective and cost-efficient than conventional humanitarian disaster relief.\r The intervention evaluated in this study is an unconditional cash transfer distributed to pastoralist households in Western Mongolia in March 2021. The cash transfer targets households in areas projected to be at very high, high, or medium risk of experiencing extreme winter conditions in the risk map released on January 10, 2021. Cash transfers to 421 households were financed by the German Federal Foreign Office. The average value of the cash transfer is 236 USD. The value of the cash transfer is informed by existing anticipatory humanitarian action programs in Mongolia, amounting to approximately 1.7 months of working for the national minimum wage or the market price of four sheep at the time of the intervention. \r The distribution of the cash transfers was implemented by the INGO People in Need (PIN) and follows an experimental design that allows for a rigorous impact evaluation. The assistance was disbursed through bank transfers. A pre-intervention survey ascertained that the potential needs of vulnerable people concerning accessing local bank branches were identified and could be addressed. Immediately after the bank transactions were completed, PIN informed recipient households via phone call or text message that they received the transfers.\r",

    "Experimental Design": "The impact evaluation builds on the Coping with Shocks in Mongolia Household Panel Survey (Kraehnert et al. 2022), which has been implemented in 3 western provinces (Govi-Altai, Zavkhan, and Uvs) of Mongolia since 2012. The initial sample comprises 1,768 households. Data from wave 4, collected between June 2020 and May 2021, serves as baseline data. Data from wave 5, collected between June 2021 and May 2022, serves as endline data.  \r The relevant population for the cash transfer intervention is households that fulfill three eligibility criteria: i) they must be sample households of the Coping with Shocks in Mongolia Household Panel Survey, ii) they must live in an area projected to be at very high, high, or medium risk of experiencing extreme winter conditions, according to a risk map published by IRIMHE on January 10, 2021, and (iii) they must own livestock. The eligibility of households was assessed based on survey data available in February 2021. At this time, data from panel wave 4 of the Coping with Shocks in Mongolia Household Panel Survey was available for 793 households. For 975 households, for whom panel wave 4 data was unavailable at the time, information from previous panel waves was used. Based on the latest available data, a study sample of 925 households meeting the three eligibility criteria was selected.\r Among these 925 eligible households, 421 were assigned to the treatment group, while 504 were allocated to the control group through a random lottery implemented in STATA by the authors. Treatment households were earmarked to receive an average of 236 USD as a one-off unconditional cash transfer from the NGO People in Need (PIN). \r Randomization was conducted on the sub-district level (using the latest information on the sub-district of residence available in February 2021). The 925 eligible households lived in 111 sub-districts. 50 sub-districts were randomly selected to comprise the treatment group. In February 2021, all eligible households in these districts were surveyed by the National Statistics Office of Mongolia (NSO) and informed that they were chosen to receive a cash transfer. Enumerators were able to locate and survey 381 of the 421 households selected for treatment. All those 381 households gave their consent to participate in the study.\r The 50 sub-districts in the treatment group were assigned to two treatment arms with varying values for the cash transfer. Eligible households in 25 sub-districts in the treatment group were assigned to receive a cash transfer of 177 USD, while eligible households in the other 25 sub-districts in the treatment group were assigned to receive a cash transfer of 295 USD. \r All those 381 households gave their consent to participate in the study. In March 2021, PIN distributed cash transfers via bank transfer to 381 households participating in the pre-intervention survey.\r Kraehnert, K., Lehmann-Uschner, K., Groppo, V., Bertram-Huemmer, V., Fluhrer, S., Mogge, L., Roeckert, J., &amp; Wojewska, A.

        "Abstract": "Anticipatory humanitarian assistance is a novel approach to aid in the context of weather disasters, drawing on meteorological forecasts. Using a randomized study design, we analyze the impact of anticipatory cash transfers distributed to pastoralist households in Mongolia before an extreme winter event reached its peak. For recipients with smaller herds before the disaster, the receipt of anticipatory cash transfers increases their post-disaster herd size, herd-related investments, and home consumption of livestock. These effects, measured on average seven months after the event, are large in magnitude and consistent across a range of robustness tests. No significant effects of the intervention are detected when considering the full sample, including relatively wealthy pastoralists. Furthermore, no heterogeneous effects are found for different levels of disaster intensity. The paper concludes by highlighting practical challenges in evaluating (anticipatory) humanitarian interventions. ",

    "Abstract": "Schools worldwide play a key role in both imparting cognitive skills and shaping students’ values, identity, and behavior. Using a novel lab-in-the-field experiment with Madrassa (religious schools) students in Pakistan, we causally examine the impact of Madrassa identity on extremist attitudes, comparing results across economic strata. We find that Madrassa identity exacerbates extremism among poorer students but mitigates it among wealthier ones, driving both groups toward collective norms. Our results challenge simplified narratives linking madrassas to extremism and offer nuanced insights into the intersection of economic deprivation, identity, and radicalization.",

    "Abstract": "About TIME (Technology in Math Education) explores how technology can best be used to promote the acquisition of math skills among young children and reduce the gap in skill development between high- and low-income children. We hypothesize that digital apps may improve young children’s math skills over the long run compared to similar non-digital learning materials both because children are likely to spend more time using digital apps compared to non-digital learning materials and because digital apps may be more efficient at conveying math skill. About TIME will proceed in two parts. The first is a series of field experiments to help us understand how technology works to promote learning (corresponding to this registration). The second is a large-scale randomized controlled trial intended to compare the increase in math skills among preschool-age children who are provided with a tablet containing high-quality math apps and a group of children provided with high-quality non-digital materials of the sort recommended by experts in math learning and intended to promote the same skills as the digital apps. The results of the About TIME Project will: 1. compare the increase in math skills for children provided with a digital tablet containing high-quality math apps to the increase for children provided with high-quality non-digital materials intended to convey the same skills, 2. estimate the extent to which parent characteristics and barriers to parent engagement influence the effect of both digital and non-digital learning tools in building child math skill, 3. estimate how parent involvement moderates the effect of digital apps relative to non-digital materials on children’s math skills, 4. estimate how digital apps affect children’s and parents’ enthusiasm for math, 5. describe which apps are used the most, when are they used, and which features of apps are most often used by children. \r  ",

Parent-child pairs will be randomly assigned to receive apps or non-digital learning materials. Parents will then be randomly assigned within the two modalities, either to be present or absent for the experiment. Holding the time constant, any difference in skill acquisition between the beginning and end of the experiment will be due to differences in the efficiency of the materials in the two scenarios where the parent is either present or absent.\r Experiment 2 (2 treatment arms):\rIn this experiment, we randomly assign parents to a treatment in which we temporarily increase their cognitive load or to a treatment in which we do not increase cognitive load. There are standard methodologies for temporarily increasing cognitive load, such as asking participants to count backward by 7s from 100 and other similar tasks that tax cognition. As in experiment 1, we test how much children learn from digital or non-digital materials. Because low-income parents are more likely to have a high cognitive load, this can also potentially explain why low-income parents engage less with their children in math activities. \r",

Experiment 2 asks how parents’ cognitive load affects children’s learning with digital and non-digital materials. \r The experiments have the same general format in that parent-child pairs will come to the experimental site, consent to the experiment, be randomized to a treatment group or a control group, and participate in a 30–45-minute experiment. Children will be given a brief assessment of a specific math skill at the beginning and end of the experiment and the difference in score will be the main outcome for each experimental comparison. Each experiment will also assess children’s enthusiasm for learning, measured by whether when given the chance children choose to spend more time on another math activity. All experiments will be live coded by researchers and video recorded for auditing purposes.\r We will survey parents at baseline and at the end of the intervention to collect data on family demographic characteristics, parents’ reports of the home learning environment, parents’ beliefs and expectations about their children’s math skill development, and parents’ expected return on their time and material investments in children’s math skill development. We will also ask questions that measure parents’ math anxiety and growth mindset and parents’ reports of the structural, behavioral, and cognitive barriers that stand in the way of their child’s math skill development. These will be used as covariates in the analysis of changes in assessment scores.

The SREM group was given educational training and a maintenance meeting. The knowledge, attitude toward self-care, and self-efficacy of the SREM group were significantly increased one week after training and maintained one week after a maintenance meeting. The SRT group also showed significant effects for same variables; however, a rebound of food salt concentration was observed one week after the maintenance meeting. No significant improvement was found in the control group. In the maintenance meeting, SREM participants reported positive effects of salt reduction and applying it in different ways based on who cooks at their houses. The SREM program was effective for maintaining knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy of salt reduction practices and could be integrated into community nursing intervention for older people with hypertension/prehypertension.

    "Intervention(s)": "Conceptual framework \rSelf-care intervention combined three different theories to increase self-care and self-efficacy of elderly patients with hypertension or prehypertension, namely Dorothea Orem’s 1993 self-care deficit theory (Taylor and Renpenning, 2011; Fawcett, 1995), Albert Bandura’s 1970s self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1994), and Martha Tyler John’s 1988 geragogy theory (Glendenning, 2000; Thomas, 2007). The conceptual framework of the intervention is shown in Figure 1. \rSalt Reduction Training (SRT)\rTo improve participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and low-salt intake while maintaining high self-efficacy, a two-day educational training, Salt Reduction Training (SRT),was conducted weekly. Each 90-minute session with 8–10 participants was followed by a 15 minute break. This training applied learning methods derived from geragogy and self-efficacy concepts. Geragogy is defined as a process involved in stimulating and helping the elderly to study (John,1988). \rIn SRT, the geragogy concept is used with frequent repetition and evaluation of key points in hypertension self-care, including demonstrating how to measure daily salt intake and prioritizing important skills. Self-efficacy concepts were utilized by stressing that maintaining a low-salt diet is easy, changing negative thoughts about salt and hypertension, and reinforcing positive attitudes during discussion. In addition, to motivate participants, trained elderly role models who had implemented low-salt diets shared their experiences about the benefits and ease of implementing a low-salt diet. Participants were given time to ask questions. To master the concepts of a low-salt diet, participants and researchers cooked a low-salt menu together during the second day of training. The majority of training information and leaflets were in pictures, including the leaflets “You Can Deal with High Blood Pressure by Reducing Salt Intake.”\rSalt Reduction and Efficacy Maintenance (SREM) program\rOne month after training, participants in the SREM group attended a 90-minutefollow-up meeting, called a maintenance meeting, designed to help them overcome difficulties and challenges they faced in applying a low-salt diet. Members in the SRT group received only the initial two-day training. Table 1 gives an overview of the intervention given to the SRT and SREM groups. During the maintenance meeting, participants shared their progress, benefits, and challenges of following a low-salt diet. Role models were invited again for interactive discussions with participants. As opposed to the mainly one-way communication by role models during the SRT, in the maintenance meeting, both role models and participants had a lively discussion because they had implemented a low-salt diet together. Any solutions and progress reported in this meeting were reinforced. Participants were given a chance to adjust their low-salt diet targets based on difficulties and solutions offered by other participants.\r",

Prior to distribution of vaccines to the general population, efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and face coverings. Although conflicting recommendations have been issued, recent evidence suggests that face masks may significantly reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, questions remain on how to effectively promote mask adoption: Despite masks being mandatory, recent evidence shows less than 20% wear them at markets in Western Kenya. Together with the Ministry of Health in Siaya county, we evaluate a pilot program that distributes a free mask to each citizen, combined with educational interventions informed by insights from behavioral economics.

Many entrepreneurs do not have the financial skills to address these challenges and traditional classroom-based financial training has not been shown effective in changing behavior or improving financial outcomes. Wha t is the most effective way to equip microentrepreneurs with the necessary skills to address their financial management challenges? Traditional financial education curricula have shown very mixed results for improving knowledge and financial practices among microentrepreneurs. In this study, the researchers build on earlier work by one of the authors that shows the promise of using a simple, heuristics-based financial education curriculum. In the current project the researchers test whether it is feasible to communicate these heuristics via mobile phone messages in a scalable and sustainable fashion. Carefully designed messages that are simple to understand and adopt will be sent at particularly useful times to optimize effectiveness. The study will measure the impact of this strategy on the financial management behavior and business outcomes of microentrepreneurs.",

    "Abstract": "Developing economies are characterized not only by low incomes but also by low savings and apparent failures to take advantage of profitable opportunities for investment (e.g. de Mel at al. 2008). One common explanation is that the poor face temptations to misspend their income which they are unable to overcome given limited financial markets, and that aggregating steady streams of small amounts of income into larger lump sums would help mitigate these problems. This assumption has helped drive the research on commitment savings accounts (Ashraf and Karlan 2006, Brune et al. 2013). However, converting smooth income streams into larger, deferred sums may also lead to increased temptation and potentially poor choices - the proverbial effect of \"money burning a hole in one's pocket\". Banerjee et al. (2010) find evidence of this behavior among some users of microfinance in Hyderabad, and increasing temptation is consistent with anecdotal reports of behavior around payday in Malawi as well as research from the developed world (e.g. Stephens 2003). It is not currently understood what factors lead certain lump sums to be beneficial to achieving savings goals, while others lead people to give in to temptation, but the specific timing of the lump sum may play a role. This project uses an RCT to explore how the timing of wage payments changes the relative benefits of lump sums vs. small installments. \r We partner with a local NGO to expand a public works program by 350 workers who are employed for 16 days over the course of three months (Oct through Dec 2013), subdivided into two rounds. Workers are cross-randomized into two sets of experimental conditions, separately for each round of the study. The first study arm varies whether workers receive their pay in a single, lump-sum payment or in weekly installments. The second study arm varies how tempting the environment is in which workers receive their payments: All workers receive their pay at the same location, which is the site of the major local market, but some receive their pay on the weekly \"market day\", while others receive it the day before. To ensure that all workers face equal transaction costs, everyone will come to the market for brief surveys on both days, irrespective of whether they are being paid. The main outcomes of interest are survey measures of saving level, expenditure composition, loans, and transfers, as well as uptake of a high-interest, zero-risk \"bond\" offered to all the workers in the study that provides an objective measure of savings behavior.",

    "Experimental Design": "The experiment was organized into two rounds that occurred over a period of three months from November 2013 to January 2014, with subjects randomized into treatment conditions separately by round. During each round, subjects worked for two weeks and then received their pay either a) in weekly installments beginning at the end of the second week of work; or b) in a single lump sum, about three weeks after the last day of work.\r In addition to variation in payment frequency, workers received their pay either c) on Fridays or d) on Saturdays. The two variations on the timing of pay -- weekly vs. monthly and Friday vs. Saturday -- were cross-randomized, creating four study arms in each round. The payments were made at the site of a major local market that occurs on Saturdays, with the intention of inducing variation in people's temptation to overspend. During the week after the last payday in each round, all workers were visited for a detailed survey about their expenditure and income.\r The variation in the day of the week of the payment was designed to shed light on the mechanisms behind the savings constraints people face. If money is received in a tempting environment, like the local market day, then arguably costs to resisting that temptation increase and workers would decide to spend and consume more right at the market when receiving their pay.\r We picked Saturdays at the local trading center -- so that payroll for this group happened during the major market in the local area -- as a tempting context for the receipt of income. This choice was based on extensive qualitative and descriptive work with people in the local area. Anecdotally, people in Mulanje District often describe market days as tempting situations, in which excitement can cause them to purchase things they would rather not. ",

    "Abstract": "The value-added tax (VAT) is one of the most important sources of domestic tax revenue in developing countries. In theory, the VAT has two desirable properties: it is more efficient than alternative tax instruments, and it is self-enforcing because the two sides of each transaction (seller and buyer) have incentives to report truthfully. However, when enforcement capacity is limited, these two properties can break down, leading to economic distortions and tax revenue losses. When cross-checking the transactions reported monthly by all VAT-registered firms in Uganda in the period 2015-2017, we estimated substantial discrepancies leading to a large revenue shortfall. \rThis experiment aims to improve compliance along the VAT chain through the implementation of a tax enforcement intervention that encourages taxpayers to amend their past tax returns and comply with tax laws in the future. Specifically, the treatment will consist of sending notification letters to about 1,000 randomly selected firm-pairs (i.e., buyer-seller pairs) with the following information: (i) their VAT returns will be closely monitored (ii) a list of up to 3 discrepancies that have been found in their past returns (iii) failure to comply could result in additional enforcement measures or prosecution. We will measure the direct effect of the letters on the tax compliance behavior of the treated firms, and also the spillover effects on their trading partners.\r",

    "Intervention(s)": "The intervention consists of sending notification letters to a randomly-selected sample of firm pairs (i.e., a seller-buyer match) for which reporting discrepancies were observed in the year before the intervention. The letters state that the tax authority has developed a new system to monitor VAT compliance and that the VAT returns will be closely monitored. The letters list up to 3 detected discrepancies and ask taxpayers to submit an amendment to correct any existing discrepancies. Finally, the letters point out that a failure to comply can result in additional enforcement measures or prosecution.",

    "Experimental Design": "The first step of the experimental design selects a \"base sample\" of firm-pairs.

Once the first firm-pair is randomly selected, we remove all the trading partners of the two firms (buyer and seller) from the base sample. Then, we randomly select another firm-pair and remove all their trading partners. Following this iterative procedure, we obtain a set of firm-pairs which are (i) separated by at least two nodes in the network of firm-to-firm transactions and (ii) have an accumulated misreporting discrepancy that is greater than 270 USD over the past year.\r In the third step, we apply a stratified randomization procedure to allocate firms from the study sample to three treatment arms and a control group. In the first treatment arm, the letter is sent only to the buyer in the selected pair. In the second treatment arm, the letter is sent to the seller. Finally, in the third arm, letters are sent to both the buyer and seller. ",

In the second step, we obtain a study sample of 1,673 firm-pairs. In the third step, we randomly assign 40% of firms (677) to be part of the control group. The remaining 60% (996) are divided up equally across the three treatment arms. In this randomization process, we stratify by the ratio of sales to final consumers, firm size (measured by total revenue from sales), and by whether or not the firms' headquarters are located in or outside Kampala (the capital city of Uganda).

While economists acknowledge that religious rules can influence individual and collective behaviors, there is still little rigorous evidence on the impact of religious rulings on health behavior. More specifically, the cognitive processes underlying the link between Islamic religious ruling and health behavior is not yet well understood. \rOur study context is Indonesia – the country with the largest Muslim population globally. With over one third of the population smoking, smoking still represents an important public health concern. In 2010, one of the country’s most important Islamic organization – Muhammadiyah –issued to an anti-smoking fatwa in order to address this issue. In this study we explore the effects of this ruling.  We employ five distinct online experiments that involve a total of 14,500 individuals, in order to better understand an individual’s cognitive processes related to smoking. More specifically, we investigate (i) the role of information uptake and avoidance, (ii) motivated reasoning and storing of information, and (iii) cognitive strategies in dealing with challenging information.   \r",

We will look at three variables namely whether (i) individuals select articles that are from the religious body in line with their religious affiliation (binary), (ii) individuals select articles that are in line with their own smoking practice (binary), and (iii) individuals select articles that are reflecting their own religious identity and their own smoking practice (ordinal).  \r II)\tInformation processing: We measure information processing in two ways: (i) by the title as a binary measure of attentiveness which reflects whether the subject can recall the correct title of the article that they have read, and (ii) measures on the recall of the content. Our recall measures on the content relate to the number of arguments subjects can correctly recall from the shown article (count data) and whether subjects can correctly remember at least three arguments as listed in the paragraphs (binary indicator).\r",

",
    "Experimental Design": "The study applies 5 online experiments. As part of the experiments online subjects are randomized into different treatment groups. In 4 out 5 experiments subjects are randomized in terms of whether they receive their preferred article choice. 3 out 5 experiments work with additional sub-randomization in which different sub-interventions are applied (psychological primes, cognitive load tasks, fact-checking). ",
    "Experimental Design Details": "All interventions are conducted as part of online surveys with different online panel providers. In total, we conduct five experiments:\r Experiment 1: Priming experiment. We randomly assign psychological primes to all study subjects. Psychological primes relate to forming ten sentences, each sentence contains of five words. There are two treatment groups (T1 and T2). In T1 all subjects receive words and sentences with non-religious content. In T2 subjects receive five sentences with religious and five sentences with non-religious content. \rAfter the priming, study subjects select their preferred information sources for different topics. There are four types of sources (media, government, academic, religious) and four types of topics (2 health topics, 1 environmental topic, 1 religious’ topic). The order in which topics appear and in which the sources are listed is randomized. \r Experiment 2: Information acquisition. Experiment 2 consists of two parts. Both parts involve a two step-process. In the first step, participants can select one out of four article titles that they would like to read. Titles reflect two different sources (Muhammadiyah vs. Nadul Ulama – two religious bodies in Indonesia) and two different opinions (pro and against smoking). In step 2 subjects are randomized into whether they receive an article that contains their preferred title (one out of four title options) or not (three out of four title options). The body of the article (three paragraphs) is identical for each subject and reflects arguments pro and against smoking. This experimental set-up is randomly assigned to 50 percent of all participants and we refer to this as PART A. For the other 50 percent of participants, the procedure is the same as in PART A, but with the exception that we indicate at both stages (article selection and article reading) whether an article was fact-checked for its content or not. At stage 1 about one fourth of the article titles are marked as fact checked; at stage 2 about 50 percent of the articles are marked as fact checked.   \r Experiment 3: Cognitive load. We experimentally alter the cognitive load of subjects. Cognitive load tasks relate to the memorization of specific numbers. There are two treatment groups (T1 and T2). In T1 study subjects are asked to memorize a 1-digit number, while in T2 study subjects are asked to memorize a 6-digit number. Following this, study subjects select their preferred article. Subjects can select from four articles titles with titles reflecting 2 opinions (pro or against smoking) and 2 sources (Muhammadiyah vs. Nadul Ulama). In a second step, subjects are randomized to receive their preferred article (one quarter of the title options) vs. a non-preferred article (three-quarter of the title options).  \r Experiment 4: Opinion vs. Source. Experiment 4 shall shed light on the role of the information source (religious source) vis-à-vis the informational direction (pro vs. against smoking) for the  preference for information and andand information processing. Experiment 4 has three treatment groups (T1, T2, T3). In T1, study subjects see only the titles of articles though no source is displayed. Once subjects select a title, subjects are randomized into receiving their preferred article or not. The article they receive does not display any source. T2 is identical to T1 with the exception that once subjects are assigned an article to read they also see the source of the article. T3 is identical to T2 with the exception that the source of the article is already revealed at the initial stage when subjects are asked to select their preferred article.  \r Experiment 5: Article styles and information processing. In experiments 1 to 4 all subjects receive the identical article. Each article contains three paragraphs reflecting different views:  One paragraph listing argument against smoking, one paragraph listing arguments why smoking might be permitted under certain circumstances, and one paragraph listing arguments why smoking should be allowed. In experiment 5, the articles displayed are changed such that they only present one position. This means that articles with titles indicating “pro-smoking” only list arguments in favor of smoking arguments, while titles indicating “against-smoking” only list arguments against smoking. Apart from the information (article) displayed, the experimental set-up of experiment 5 is identical to experiment 2 (part A).\r",

    "Intervention (Hidden)": "The study will use a randomized evaluation design to test whether training science tutors to provide tailored remedial education with a focus on scientific inquiry improves science test-score performance and attitudes towards science.  The science remedial education will target third-grade children whose prior science achievement places them in the bottom half of their class. \r The first component of the program consists of tutor recruitment and pre-service training.  Prior to the start of the school year, UCH will select potential tutors—preferably women that could serve as role models for girls—who are either science schoolteachers or college students majoring in pedagogy. Before classes begin, UCH will also provide a 20-hour long introductory training course. The course will emphasize the use of the scientific inquiry method and how to follow school curricula while ensuring all students make individual progress. Training sessions will take place at UCH in March 2014 and will span 2.5 days.   \r The second program component is the remedial instruction. Tutoring groups will be composed of up to 10 students per tutor, with anywhere between two to three tutoring groups per school, given that the average number of expected third grade students per school is 48. Each tutor will be assigned to between four to six schools from the sample. To ensure buy-in from schools despite the relatively low number of students who will be receiving tutoring, UCH will organize workshops to motivate principals and teachers, and another workshop to motivate and engage parents of students that are selected for tutoring. \r Tutoring sessions will last about 1.5 hours and will take place at the same school that the students that receive tutoring attend. Tutoring sessions will be scheduled after the regular school day ends or on Saturday mornings, as determined by parents, teachers, and the school principal. The intensity of the remedial course will be equivalent to an additional 40 percent of total hours dedicated to Science and Environment during the academic year. Tutors will be paid students wages according to Peruvian law for the training sessions as well as each tutoring session they conduct.\r In addition, during the school year tutors will receive ongoing support through weekly progress review sessions, and in-session support once every two months. The UCH team will also make unannounced visits to monitor that remedial classes are taking place as planned.\r",

    "Experimental Design": "Randomization will take place at the student level, with a separate lottery for each participating school. All third grade students from a given school will take the baseline exam that will identify students that place in the lowest half in each school.  The evaluation will target 48 schools in metropolitan Lima that participated in either treatment or control groups in the 2012 pilot project. ",
    "Experimental Design Details": "The evaluation will target low-performing third-grade students from 48 schools in metropolitan Lima that participated in either treatment or control groups in the 2012 pilot project.  Within each school, half of the low-performing students will be assigned to the remedial education treatment and half to control conditions.  The evaluation design will therefore stratify at the school level.  \r According to total enrollment levels collected from school principals at baseline in 2012, we anticipate, on average, 48 third-grade students per school distributed in two third-grade sections per school.   Logistical reasons explain why we aim to target the same schools as the 2012 pilot. In the treatment schools, UCH already has contacts with the administration, which should facilitate the implementation of the program.  In addition, data collection by IPA in the control schools went according to plan and there was little attrition and non-response.\r IPA Peru will administer a baseline evaluation test to students in April 2014. This test will be a similar though simplified version of the science test that was used in the 2012 Science Education pilot. This test was developed to assess third-grade science proficiency according to the Peruvian National Curriculum, which includes as subdomains: “Physical World” (“Mundo Físico y conservación del ambiente”), “Human body and health” (“Cuerpo humano y conservación de la salud”) and “Animals and environment conservation” (“Animales y ambiente”). It is a timed self-administered written test that students will be given to complete on their own, without a surveyor. A surveyor will be present at the school to supervise the appropriate and timely administration of the test. Each section (corresponding to one of the three areas of the curriculum) is separately timed.\r During the implementation of the program, IPA Peru will develop an end-line test of the same abilities measured for the baseline. The test will be given at the end of the school year to all the third grade students in participating schools to see if those who were placed in the treatment group were able to close the gap with the other students from their class. Both baseline and end-line will be norm-referenced, standardizing all student test scores in standard deviations above or below the control group mean. \r In addition, teachers will be surveyed to collect demographic data and to gather their views on different aspects of teaching Science and Environment. Collecting this information at baseline and end-line will permit observing any changes in teacher’s perceptions of teaching science material. School directors of the sample schools will also be surveyed about their experience and characteristics of their schools, including the number of teachers, school enrollment, infrastructure, equipment and learning materials and school climate.  Lastly, students will be sent home with questionnaires for parents with questions about the support and assistance that the child receives for homework, the household's socioeconomic status and other characteristics such as household size and education of parents. Both the data collected at baseline from the school directors and parents will serve to ensure balance between treatment and control groups.  Additionally, the data will also be used to perform heterogeneity analysis to identify variation in effects between subgroups, such as students in homes with a working television, or students in schools with operational sanitation facilities\r",

Specifically, we expect that among the 48 participating schools in metropolitan Lima, there will be approximately 1100 students that place in the lowest half of the baseline achievement distribution. Among these 1100 students, half will be randomly assigned to treatment and the other half will be assigned to control conditions. The attrition rate during the 2012 Science Education pilot was 13 percent, and a more conservative 15 percent is used for these power size calculations. A correlation of 0.576 between baseline and end line was calculated, based on the 2012 sample of students. Assuming a five percent level of significance and 80 percent statistical power, the expected minimum detectable treatment effect is (MDE) 0.16 standard deviations. As the randomization will be stratified by school, this reduces the MDE holding all other parameters constant, making this MDE likely a conservative estimate. We find it is reasonable to conduct an empirical study in which the MDE is 0.16 given the results of previous remedial and tracking programs, ranging from .14 to .28 standard deviations.",

Delayed graduation contributes to the student debt burden by increasing tuition payments without any additional wage premium. Behavioral theory suggests that young adults are prone to biases limiting their ability to connect short-run actions with long-run outcomes. We attempt to correct these biases using a low-touch financial literacy intervention within a randomized encouragement design at Pennsylvania State University, a large public university. We randomly invite and incentivize students to participate in an online tutorial connecting short-run academic success to long-run debt obligations and examine differences in academic outcomes. We will examine the effect on credit accumulation, retention, and GPAs.  We will also examine the effect for subgroups of interest including those more at risk of delayed graduation.",

We conduct an experiment in the laboratory and on an online platform, where workers individually engage in the same task and are individually paid a piece-rate wage. Workers receive information about their own wage and the wage of another worker as well as on the procedure leading to these wages. A worker’s labor supply decision only affects him- or herself. That is, providing less labor reduces the worker’s earnings but leaves unaffected the other workers’ earnings and the employer’s earnings.",

    "Intervention (Hidden)": "This study tests the effectiveness of email nudges at encouraging AEA RCT Registry users to update post-trial fields after the study has ended. The interventions will be email-based nudges and will be tested against a control email. Randomization is at the registration level, but the treatment will be at the \"collaborator\" level, with \"collaborator\" defined as anyone who has an AEA RCT Registry account and has been signed up as an editing collaborator on the registry entry. That is, each collaborator on a study will receive the same treatment (email nudge). Because of this, individuals in our sample that are collaborators on more than one trial will get multiple treatments (emails), one for each trial, and will most likely receive different treatments (see the \"experimental details\" section for more).\r Each treatment will consist of up to four emails, depending on how (to what extent) registrants respond to the first email. Specifically, all collaborators in the sample will receive the first email. If a collaborator visits their registration and makes any change to the trial entry within one week of the visit, they (and the other collaborators on the registration) will not receive any further emails. The follow-up emails will be identical to the original email received and will happen at periods of roughly two weeks from when the previous email was sent. If collaborators do not act on any of the four emails, interventions will end once the last (third) follow-up email has been sent.\r We will send the emails through Qualtrics, which caps the number of emails that can be sent within one week. We will hence split the sample into two groups – those that are part of the “main registration network” and those that are not. The main network is defined as the largest connected set of collaborators in the bipartite graph defined by registrations and collaborators in our sample. \r The treatment arms are as follows:\rControl: collaborators will receive a standard email very similar to the automated currently sent to any users that are approaching the end date for their trial (the normal emails will be stopped at least two weeks ahead of intervention start). The control email provides a reminder that the registrant’s trial has ended and provides a link to the follow-up page that allows for entering/editing post-trial fields.\r Treatment 1 (Salience of missing information): collaborators will receive an email that lists the post-trial fields for which the entry does not have any information (with the list in a large box in the middle of the email).\r Treatment 2 (Incentive/lottery): collaborators will receive an email that informs them that if they complete their post-trial fields within two weeks they will be entered into a lottery to win a $100 Amazon gift card (also placed in a large box in the middle of the email)\rAdditionally, both treatment 1 and treatment 2 emails share the following common elements:\r- homogenous formatting and text beyond the differences described above\r- a large red button that takes registrants to the page where they can edit their fields.\r- Two reminders to registrants:\r        - completing a registration helps other researchers both conduct their own research and to find and cite the collaborator's\r         - registrants who don't update their PTR fields within two years of trial end date are far less likely to do so at all",

    "Experimental Design Details": "This study will test the effectiveness of two types of nudges, \"salience of missing information\" and a lottery, at prompting collaborators to update the post-trial fields on their registration. The treatments are randomized at the trial entry level, and each individual in the sample will receive one set of emails (initial and, if needed, follow-up) per registration for which they are listed as a \"collaborator\", with the email content varying depending on whether the registration has been assigned to control, treatment 1, or treatment 2. As individuals on multiple trials will receive multiple emails and, most likely, multiple treatments, we will test both spillovers and dosage effects by including terms in our main specification for counts of control, treatment 1, and treatment 2 emails received per trial, as well as the number of collaborators on a trial.\r Randomization is stratified by a categorical variable with three values: 1) “single trial PIs”: trials where no collaborator is listed on any other trial; 2) “multi-trial PIs”: trials where at least one collaborator is on at least one other trial, but no collaborators are on five or more other trials; and 3) “many-trial PIs”: trials where at least one collaborator is on at least five other trials.\r Within the strata the randomization probability is set to weight all three arms evenly so as to produce three arms per stratum with near-equal numbers of trial entries. \r We start with all collaborators on all trials listed on the AEA RCT Registry. We then apply 4 ex-ante sample restrictions. Specifically, the trials must:\r - Be at least one year post the listed trial end date as of the sample extraction date \r- Have some empty post-trial fields, with the set of relevant fields described in the pre-analysis plan\r- Not have any collaborators who meet any of the following “centrality”-related criteria:\r        - be listed on &gt;=20 registry entries\r        - be a collaborator on trials with &gt;=20 other collaborators\r Collaborators on trials that meet the following criteria will still receive treatment, but we will\rexclude them from the main analysis:\r- Any collaborator on the trial was in the 63-person sample for our associated qualitative survey of registry users",

    "Abstract": "The era of social media networks has deeply affected the relationship political content, entertainment and political participation. While research has shown that social media use fosters political engagement, we still observe widespread low political participation, even among the young, who use social media most extensively. To increase participation, governments and politicians have taken advantage of social media influencers (and their huge resonance on social media) to spread political messages targeting young audiences. As political scientists, we lack an understanding of the real effect that these messages have on people’s political identity, preferences and behaviors, both online and offline. In this work, I aim at shedding light on the role that political content on social media, channeled through non-political actors, has in shaping young adults’ political identity, attitudes and their conception of political activism. Taking advantage of the European Elections, I use an experimental setting to test the effects of the language used and para-social relationships established by social media personalities on their pages. I argue that this work will contribute to the understanding of how social media, with their ingrained economic, political and psychological incentives, affect the way young people socialize themselves into the political process and will help us to predict the future of political engagement and participation, both in the virtual and real world.",

    "Intervention(s)": "Supportive Parenting is a targeted preventive intervention in which youth healthcare nurses visit parents at home to support them in raising a child. The intervention was originally developed to prevent parenting problems and child maltreatment and generally improves the living environment of the child. Supportive Parenting is currently offered by 188 out of the 344 municipalities in the Netherlands. Around the 14th day after birth, a nurse who works at a child health clinic (consultatiebureau) visits every family in the Netherlands with a newborn child. During this visit, the nurse explains to all parents in regions that offer Supportive Parenting what the intervention entails and hands out a questionnaire that is used to identify eligible parents. The screening questionnaire tries to identify parents who are at risk of child maltreatment. The items to determine eligibility were carefully selected during the development of the intervention and the choice of variables is explained in detail by Bouwmeester et al. (2006). The questionnaire contains items on the following domains: parents' childhood experiences, parents' perceptions and expectations, parents' mental health, parents' history with substance abuse, parents' relationship with their partner, parents' social support system, parents' age, and the child's health at birth. \r After the screening, nurses contact families that are eligible for the intervention by phone. The nurse again explains the intervention, discusses the outcomes of the screening questionnaire, and schedules the first house visit. Supportive Parenting is a voluntary programme, where additional support is offered to parents who could use some extra help. The nurse explains to parents that children benefit when their parent is doing well, when they are comfortable and confident in their parenting, and when they are aware of the effect their own childhood experiences can have on their behaviour. Supportive Parenting helps parents be the best version of themselves, which will in turn benefit the child. Ideally, Supportive Parenting is offered to all parents, but for financial reasons the intervention is targeted. The nurse explains to parents that the questionnaire they filled out helps nurses to find those parents who would possibly benefit most from Supportive Parenting. The intervention is not a way for municipalities to monitor parental behaviour or to check whether child maltreatment takes place within the household. \r After eligible parents indicate their interest in the intervention, a youth healthcare nurse visits parents when the child is approximately 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months old. This is in addition to care as usual, e.g. the normal visits to the child health clinics. Depending on the family situation, additional visits might be planned, either as house visits or a phone consultation. Visits are generally between 60 and 90 minutes each, depending on parental preferences. For example, some parents prefer to have shorter house visits that occur more often. The nurses who conduct house visits work at a child health clinic (consultatiebureaus) and receive additional training before the start of the intervention. During this training, nurses learn all the practicalities of the intervention, such as the structure of the house visits, the content to be discussed with parents, and the material available. Nurses learn how to explain the intervention to parents and how to discuss the sometimes delicate questionnaire items with them. In Supportive Parenting, nurses focus on the ontogenic system, the microsystem, and the exosystem used by Belsky (1980) and on the concept of parental awareness used by Baartman (1996) to explain child maltreatment. Belsky (1980) argues that there are stress and support factors in the ontogenic system, which regards the individual parent, the microsystem, which includes their immediate family, and the exosystem, which regards the broader social support system. Nurses learn to identify these factors of support and stress. Baartman (1996) explains child abuse by looking at conflicting interests between parents and children. He divides parental awareness into expectations, perceptions, and sensitivity. Nurses help parents to understand their expectations of and perceptions on the development of their child. They also focus on parents' sensitivity, defined as the ability of parents to see, understand, and anticipate what a child needs and to adequately respond to this. The training teaches nurses to identify factors of improvement. For example, for the development of children, healthy bonding with their parent is important. Nurses learn how to recognise attachment styles that are secure, avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganised. They then learn how to respond to the signals they pick up on. The training includes sufficient time for nurses to practice, with an actress playing a mother who is eligible for the intervention. The Supportive Parenting training takes approximately 18 hours.\r During the house visits, nurses guide parents by open questions to indicate what their struggles are and where they would like to see improvement. The lengthy house visits give nurses far more time, compared to the regular child health clinic visits, to listen to parents and truly understand where nurses can support them best. The main topics of discussion include the development of the child, the expectations and experiences of the parents, and the social life and support system of the parents. For the development of the child, the nurse and parents focus on the health of the child, their sleeping pattern, and the relation between the child and the parents. For the expectations and experiences of parents, parents get the opportunity to talk about their own childhood. The nurse listens to their stories and helps them reflect on their experiences. This helps parents to understand where certain behaviours come from and whether their expectations are realistic. The nurse and parents use this to improve unhealthy parenting behaviours. For the social life and support system of parents, the nurse helps parents in combining parenthood with having a job, having a social life, and having a partner. It is important for parents to have a balance in their lives and it can be difficult for (new) parents to combine all these obligations. Here, the nurse and parents focus on building a network for practical and social support. The nurse helps parents to realise who they can turn to for support. This support can come from within the parents' network, from new social contacts, or from professional help. If needed, the nurse guides parents into finding further professional support, such as psychological help.",

    "Primary Outcomes (end points)": "- Parents' view on parenthood.\r- Educational outcomes of children.\r- Mental health of children.",
    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "- Parents' views on parenthood are measured by the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI), when the child is 0, 1, and 2 years old. We use this construct to see if the intervention affects parents' self-reported views on parenthood. The AAPI is divided into five constructs: inappropriate parental expectations, parental lack of an empathetic awareness of children’s needs, strong belief in the use and value of corporal punishment, parent-child role reversal, and oppressing children’s power and independence.\r- For educational outcomes, we look at generalised test scores at the end of primary school (age 12), binding advice by teacher about educational level to enroll in during secondary school (age 12), and education enrolled in at age 16.\r- For mental health outcomes, we look at children's scores on the KIPPPI (Kort Instrument voor de Psychologische en Pedagogische Probleem Inventarisatie) at age 0, 1, and 2. The KIPPPI is an instrument to identify problematic soico-emotional development of children and is divided into the following domains: eating, sleeping, toilet training, motor skills, activity, autonomy, mental development, language/speech, play, social relationships and interactions, mood, personality, behaviour, and fear. We also look at children's' scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at age 5. This is a screening instrument for psycho-social problems and skills in children between 2 and 17 years old. With the questionnaire answers, an overall SDQ score is computed, as well as separate scores on the 5 domains: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, peer  problems,  and  pro-social  behaviour. We are in the process of obtaining scores for children at later ages. In addition to test scores, we look at children's mental health diagnoses, treatments, and medication use. We expect this data to only be available until 2015.",
    "Secondary Outcomes (end points)": "- The use of other interventions and professional help by parents and children. This includes, among other things,\rsocial work, preschool, parenting aid, and psychological help.\r- Mental health of parents.\r- Social support of parents.\r- Parental views and experience of stress when the child is 5.\r- Physical health of children.\r- Physical health of parents.\r- Financial situation of parents, including parents’ education, income, and job.\r- Later born children, including the timing of having additional children and the number of siblings. We also have information on the perinatal health of later born children.\r If possible, we look at heterogeneity in treatment effects in the following domains: \r- Scores on the eligibility questionnaire. The screening scores indicate the extent to which parents are seen to be at risk of child abuse.\r- Treatment intensity. We know the length and content of all house visits. Depending on the variation in the data, we want to see if treatment effects are stronger (weaker) for parents who received more (less) hours of treatment and who discussed more (less) topics.\r- Child in the intervention is first born child.\r- Gender of the child.",
    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "- For mental health outcomes, we have parents’ scores on the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) when the child is 0, 1, and 2 years old. We use items of this questionnaire, such as ”life often seems meaningless to me”. In addition, we look at parents’ mental health diagnoses, treatments, and medication use. We expect this data to only be available until 2015.\r- For social support, we use parents’ self-reported information about their social support system. For this, we use the answers on the Social Support questionnaire, when the child is 0, 1, and 2 years old. We also have information on changes in their marital status.\r- For parental views and experience of stress, we use questionnaire data from the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) and the Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index (Nosi-R). The former measures the risk of maltreatment and the latter measures the stress parents experience. This data is only available for a subsample.\r- For children's physical health, we have data at age 2, as reported by a nurse from a child health clinic and by a general practitioner. In addition, we have their medical history, including treatment reports, hospitalisations, and medication use.\r",
    "Experimental Design": "We use data from the RCT conducted in 2002. Parents are randomly divided into treatment and control groups. At the start of the intervention, all parents fill out the following questionnaires:\r- Kort Instrument voor de Psychologische en Pedagogische Probleeminventarisatie (KIPPPI): an instrument to identify problematic socio-emotional development of children.\r- Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI): an instrument to estimate the risk of maltreatment.\r- Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI): an instrument developed to look at parental behaviour on the domains of inappropriate parental expectations, parental lack of an empathetic awareness of children’s needs, strong belief in the use and value of corporal punishment, parent-child role reversal, and oppressing children’s power and independence.\r- Social Support questionnaire: an instrument to map parents' support system.\r Those in the control group receive care as usual, e.g. standard visits to child health clinics. Parents in the treatment group receive six house visits of 90 minutes each, when the child is 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months old. During each visit, the nurse who conducts the house visits, reports on the general development of the child, the bond between the parent(s) and child, the problems the parent(s) experience(s) in raising the child, and the social support system of the parent(s). \r When the child is 12 months old, parents in both groups again fill out questionnaires (KIPPPI, CAPI, AAPI, Social Support). In addition, when the child is 12 months old, a doctor at the child health clinic (consultatiebureau) and a general practitioner report on the development of the child. At the end of the intervention, parents again fill out questionnaires (KIPPPI, CAPI, AAPI, Social Support). Parents also fill out a reflection questionnaire about their experience with Supportive Parenting and the nurse who conducts the house visits fills out a final report. When the child is 24 months old, a doctor at the child health clinic and a general practitioner report on the development of the child. \r For a subgroup of our sample, we have follow-up data. When these children are 5 years old, their parents receive questionnaires from the school nurse. These include the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI), and the Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index (Nosi-R). The SDQ is an instrument to diagnose psycho-social problems in children. The Nosi-R is an instrument to estimate the stress parents experience. The SDQ is handed out to all children, whereas the other questionnaires are only handed out to those who are part of the intervention or treatment group.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objective: Job-related stress undermines occupational, personal, and organizational outcomes. Stress symptoms are common among teachers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and affect the academic progress of the children. This study investigated the effectiveness of Yoga- based cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing occupational stress among teachers of children with autism in Lagos states, Nigeria. \rMethods: The current study adopted a group-randomized waitlist control trial design with pretest, post-test, and follow-up assessments. Participants included 75 teachers of children with autism in public and private special schools in Lagos state. Participants were randomly assigned to Y-CBT (N=33) and waitlist control (WLC) (N=32) groups. The Y-CBT group participated in a 2 hours Y-CBT program weekly for 12 weeks. Three instruments- Demographic Questionnaire, Single Item Stress Questionnaire (SISQ), and Teachers’ Stress Inventory (TSI) were used to collect data. Data were collected at baseline; post-test and follow-up evaluations. Data were analyzed using means, standard deviations, t-test statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and bar charts. \rResults: Results revealed that all dimensions of job stress (perception of stress sources, stress manifestation, and total TSI scores) reduced significantly at post-test and follow-up assessments among the Y-CBT group, compared to the WLC. \rConclusion: It was concluded that Y-CBT modalities could help to minimize the perception of stress sources and stress manifestation as well as Total TSI scores among teachers of children with ASD.\rList of Abbreviations: ASD=Autism Spectrum Disorders; Y-CBT=Combined CBT and Yoga; CBT=Cognitive behavioural Therapy; ABCDE=Activating Event, Beliefs, Consequences, Disputation and Effective World View; WLG=Waitlist Group; SISQ = Single-Item Stress Questionnaire; TSI= Teachers’ Stress Inventory; SS= Stress Sources; SM=Stress Manifestation SPSS=Statistical Package for Social Sciences; ANOVA=Analysis of Variance; n=sample; M= mean; SD= standard deviation; Df=Degree of Freedom; t=t-test statistic; p=probability value; CI=Confidence Interval; F =Analysis of variance test statistic; ŋ2=Partial Eta Squared (effect size). \r",

    "Intervention(s)": "A Yoga-Cognitive behavioural therapy program manual was developed by two of the researchers in collaboration with two experts (one in CBT and the other in Yoga). In developing the manual, CBT strategies were blended with after-session Yoga exercises. The CBT sessions were based on using the “ABCDE” model (Antecedent/Activating event, Beliefs, Consequences, Disputing, and Effective new philosophy) to identify, assess, revalidate and change unhelpful absolutistic and irrational beliefs associated with work experiences. The major aims of Y-CBT were to 1) use ABCDE group therapeutic model (CBT) in “disputing” – challenging and questioning teachers’ work-related irrational and dysfunctional beliefs and to replace them with rather helpful and functional beliefs [84] 2); use yoga to reduce the physiological symptoms of stress and helping the participants oust of the vicious circle of negative thoughts through Yoga “Victory Meditation,” affirmations and physical exercises.[55] This framework helped provide a targeted mind/body approach to stress perceptions, reactions, and symptoms.\rThe ABCDE formed the basis of explaining the relationships links between activating\r (A) events associated with teaching children with ASD, dysfunctional thoughts, beliefs or cognitions  arising  from  those events (B);\tthe emotional and behavioral consequences of the beliefs (C) [84] Then, disputation techniques (D) are used to eliminate the maladaptive, dysfunctional, and self-limiting beliefs and cognitions. [84, 85, 86] Disputation involves challenging and comparing the maladaptive thoughts with more adaptive ones. Ellis [87] theorized that the best way to counter irrational beliefs is by considering realistic and logical ones. Hence as participants become aware of and counteract their dysfunctional beliefs, they come up with more effective world-views (E). This ABCDE model as used in earlier studies formed the basis of activities throughout the intervention (See table 1).\rYoga complementary approaches involved after-session physical/posture exercise and meditation practices. The interaction between cognitions, emotions, and physical symptoms were highlighted and skills were taught to reduce the incongruity between sensation and perception. Traditional Yoga (asanas, breathing exercises, and meditation) exercises were used in maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The traditional Yoga used in this study was appropriate for beginners, given that it is mild and does not demand too much effort. The Yoga intervention was meant to help participants understand and appreciate the interplay between their bodily sensations and emotional feelings. Ten different asanas posses were used, which are Tadasana (Mountain pose); Vrikshasana (Tree Pose); Adho Mukho Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog Pose); Trikonasana (Triangle Pose); Kursiasana(Chair Pose);  Naukasana (Boat Pose); Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose); Paschimottanasana; Child's Pose and Sukhasna. [88]\rBreathing exercises focused on basic Breath Awareness; Ujjayi Pranayama (Victorious Breath or Ocean Breath); Kapalabhati Pranayama (Breath of Fire or Skull-Shining Breath); Kumbhaka Pranayama (Breath Retention), Nadi Shodhana Pranayama (Alternate-Nostril Breathing). Meditation involved getting quiet, calm, and focused; mind slows down, relaxation, and staying positive by focusing on something that brings you peace to mind as well as choosing to shed go all the negative thoughts that interfere with health. Meditation also helps you become more mindful of your mind and body.\rHence, in Y-CBT we designed a 12 weeks module of CBT accompanied by traditional yoga exercises as discussed above. Each session of the module includes information, exercises, worksheets, images, examples, homework exercises, and template for progress feedback.\r",

More broadly, it is important to know how experimental results vary when the context, or design, changes, that is, how heterogeneous the findings are. For example, how sensitive experimental results are to the demographics of the sample? How do they depend on the output measure used? How critical is the experimental protocol? We consider these questions in the context of a real effort task. We run variants of the same experimental treatments, varying one-by-one the demographic group considered, the task used, the measure of effort, and whether subjects know that the task is an experiment. We examine how much the experimental results change in response to these changes, compared to a pure replication.",

Before the participants choose to participate, they will be provided with a brief description of the study (a” typing task”) which also tells a guaranteed flat-pay for successful submission ($1) and a time estimate for completion. Once in the task, participants are assigned to one of four versions, and within each version they are directed to complete a task with randomly-selected incentive structures. \r Version 1 is a direct replication of the task used by DellaVigna and Pope (REStud 2018): participants press two alternating keyboard buttons ('a' and 'b') within a given time period (10 minutes). There are 16 different randomly-assigned treatments with varying levels and types of incentives. For example, some participants will be given bonus payments based on points scored, others will raise money for charity, and some will receive no bonus. All participants are clearly informed of their incentive structure and bonus opportunities before playing their task.  There is no deception at any point in this task.\r Version 2 is similar to Version 1 except that the task consists of coding the occupation from World War II historical cards for 10 minutes. As in version 1, the participants are randomized in one of 16 treatments with varying levels and types of incentives.\r Version 3 involves coding of WWII cards, as in Version 2. However, this time all subjects are required to code 40 cards as their main task. After the coding of the 40 cards is completed, subjects are randomized into 16 different treatments, parallel to the ones used in Version 1 and 2. The treatments consist of different incentives offered to the participants in case they agree to code additional WWII cards, up to 20 extra cards. \r Version 4 is the same as version 3, except that, unlike in Versions 1-3, there is no consent form prior to participating in the tasks, so subjects do not know that the task is an experiment. (Notice that the participants are coding historical data as part of an economic history project, so this is a data coding assignment.)\r         Upon completion of the task, participants will be thanked for their contribution and the flat payment of $1, along with any additional money won, will be paid within the designated time period for their treatment (typically within 24 hours). \r The final sample will exclude subjects that:\r(1)\tdo not complete the MTurk task within 30 minutes of starting;\r(2)\texit and then re-enter the task as a new subject (as these individuals might see multiple treatments);\r(3)\tare not approved for any other reason (e.g. they did not having a valid MTurk ID);\r(4)\tIn version 1 (a-b typing) do not complete a single effort unit; there is no need for a parallel requirement for version 2 since the participants have to code a first card to start the task;\r(5)\tin version 1 scored 4000 or more a-b points (since this would indicate cheating);\r(6)\tin version 2 coded 120 or more cards with accuracy below 50% (since this would indicate cheating);\r(7)\tin versions 3 and 4 completed the 40 required cards in less than 3 minutes with accuracy below 50%, or completed the 20 additional cards in less than 1.5 minutes with accuracy below 50% (since this would indicate cheating).\r Restrictions (1)–(5) are exactly the same as in the DellaVigna-Pope (REStud) experiment; restrictions (6)-(7) are meant to parallel restriction (5) for the new task. We expect that restrictions (3)-(7) are likely to be binding in only a small number of cases. For example, in a pilot of 400 subjects we did not have anyone in categories (3)-(7).\r         The average score in each of these treatments and versions will form the basis for the elicitation of expert forecasts.",
    "Experimental Design Details": "",
    "Randomization Method": "The assignment of subjects into versions and treatments is determined as follows. The subjects are assigned into one of the four versions randomly, with versions 2, 3, and 4 oversampled by 15 percent. This is in anticipation of the fact that the historical task used in version 2-4 will likely have a higher share of subjects not complete the task due to, for example, difficulty in reading cursive writing (employed in these cards). These subjects will thus not pass the sample restrictions above. In pilot data, we observed higher attrition in these versions by about 15 percent. The overweighting is designed to equate as much as possible the post-attrition sample size across the four versions. Within a version, we randomize participants into one of the 16 treatments with equal weights. ",

Version 2 should have a similar statistical power, and Versions 3 and 4 should have higher statistical power based on model-base simulations and on a small pilot.",

    "Abstract": "In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a bill with historic climate provisions, through the budget reconciliation process. The IRA was the most substantial package of climate legislation in US history, and it represented a major win for the US climate movement. However, it is project to accomplish only about 65% of the remaining emissions reductions required to reach the US' nationally-determined contributions to the Paris Agreement. This experiment will test how learning about the IRA's major, but incomplete, political win for the climate movement affects motivation to continue advocating for climate policy. Alongside, the experiment will also test the impacts of linking the IRA with a fictional story about the citizen-led climate movement that led to the bill's passage. We have three primary outcomes. First, we measure participants' collective external efficacy beliefs. Second, we have two primary measures of citizen action on climate change. The first is whether participants write and take steps to a letter to Congress about climate policy, and the second is donations of potential lottery winnings to climate advocacy groups. We supplement the main experimental survey, during which we collect our primary outcomes, with an obfuscated follow-up survey with additional measures of political engagement. ",

To answer this question, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) partnered with the Private Education Development Network (PEDN) to design and implement the Super Savers Program. A school based savings program, the Super Savers Program aimed to connect savings and education in Uganda. Along with program implementation, IPA directed a research study to assess the program’s impact. \r The study used a randomized control design to measure the impact of different variations of the Super Savers Program. In one variation, students who participated received their savings in cash at school, with some encouragement to invest their savings towards school expenditures. In the second variation, the savings payout was provided in a more restrictive form: vouchers requiring an education-related purchase. Students at a third group of schools served as a comparison. \r The program variation which included a savings payout in the form of cash generated higher savings in the program accounts. When combined with a parent outreach program, the program led to an increase in the percentage of children in the classroom with basic scholastic materials and an 8% increase in test scores on an exam covering language and math skills. We find no effect for the fully-committed account, and we find no effect for either account on attendance, enrollment, or non-cognitive skills. \r The results from this study contribute to existing research in two ways: First, while we know that savings programs are particularly effective when tied to a specific goal—such as education—putting too many restrictions on payouts can be counteractive. Second, reaching out to parents and households can be an important way to improve primary education.\r",

    "Intervention(s)": "Working with a local nonprofit organization Private Education Development Network (PEDN) in the Busoga sub-region of the Eastern region of Uganda, we randomly assigned 136 primary schools to one of three groups: a strong commitment savings account, a weak commitment savings account, or control. For both treatments Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) developed a brief training component for the teachers, and also coordinated the transfer of money from a savings box held at the school to a local bank for safekeeping. One year into the implementation, we implemented one sub-treatment, a parental involvement workshop, in half of the treatment schools. We measured school inputs, test scores, and attendance, both before and after the intervention. ",

All scales were converted after the fact so that higher on the scale meant more positive attitude toward saving. (1) Saving money is not necessary if you live at home with your family. (2) Saving is a good thing to do. (3) Saving is for adults only. (4) My parents or relatives would be proud of me for saving. (5) Managing to save makes me feel happy with myself.

    "Experimental Design": "We selected 136 primary schools from the Jinja, Iganga, Mayuge and Luuka districts of the Busoga Region because they predominantly comprised poor rural and peri-urban schools. We then administered a baseline survey and test during the final trimester of 2009. We then randomly assigned schools to receive either the cash treatment, voucher treatment, or no treatment. Each treatment group comprised 39 schools, and the remaining 58 schools became the control group.\r Following the first randomization, school outreach began. It took two trimesters to recruit the majority of schools, but by the beginning of the third trimester of 2010, 95 percent of the treatment schools had agreed to participate.\r In 2011, we conducted a second randomization for the parent sensitization program, to isolate the effect of the program while still treating all of the schools. Half of the treatment schools were assigned to receive the treatment in the first term of 2011 while the rest received the treatment during the second term. \r Finally, we conducted the follow-up survey and exam during the beginning of the third trimester of 2011.

With such externalities to non-users, standard consumer surplus measures, which take aggregate consumption as given, fail to appropriately capture consumer welfare. We propose an approach to account for these externalities and apply it to estimate consumer welfare from two social media platforms: TikTok and Instagram. Incentivized experiments with college students indicate positive welfare based on the standard measure, but negative welfare when accounting for these non-user externalities. Our findings highlight the existence of product market traps, where active users of a platform prefer it not to exist.",

Microcredit clients, however, often have neither the smooth income nor singular moments in which to make lumpy investments throughout the year.  This mismatch generates a cash flow disconnect and, given the presumed liquidity constraints of the typical microcredit client, a potential welfare loss.  Using data from a randomized evaluation with dairy farmers in rural India, we test the impact of flexible microcredit repayment schedules relative to \"normal\" inflexible, fixed repayment schedules.  Although we are only able to track those who borrow, which introduces potential selection effects, we find amongst those in flexible lending groups some evidence for higher ability to absorb shocks and higher income, which seems to be driven by limited improvements in investment and higher production from milk.  On the cost-side, defaults do increase for the lender.  Towards the end of the study, the microcredit market encountered crisis, with mass defaults, thus it is hard to generalize with respect to the default results.  We conclude with caution, that we have shown suggestive evidence that a more flexible product design, one tailored to the needs of a dairy farmer, may be welfare enhancing for the dairy farmer.  Further work is needed to both validate these results, and explore how to balance any trade-off with default.",

    "Intervention(s)": "In conjunction with a partner microfinance institution, the researchers conducted an RCT to evaluate the impact of offering loan products with flexible repayment schedules.  The sample is 3,648 existing clients of the partner MFI, organized into 202 joint-liability borrowing groups of 15-20 members prior to the experiment.  The borrowing groups were randomly assigned to receive an offer of one of four types of loans.  The small fixed-schedule loan was the standard loan offered to borrowing groups prior to the intervention.  Borrowing groups were offered a Rs. 4000 loan amount, repaid on a fixed schedule at monthly meetings.  A large fixed-schedule loan offered borrowing groups a Rs. 6000 loan, also repaid on a fixed schedule at monthly meetings.  Next, the coupon flexible loan offered borrowing groups Rs. 6000, but allowed principal repayment on a flexible schedule.  After making the first three regular monthly payments, borrowers were allowed to lag behind by up to two principal payments.  However, the borrowers still had to attend monthly repayment meetings to make an interest payment.  Borrowers’ standing was tracked in a coupon booklet with a lending officer’s help.  The last loan type, the dairy-focused loan, offered a loan of Rs. 6000, required borrowers to make double principal payments for the first six months, then allowed borrowers to skip principal payments for any consecutive six months after that while still making interest payments at monthly repayment meetings.",

    "Experimental Design": "The analysis was conducted using the intent-to-treat approach.  Immediately after disbursement, the researchers began the first of seven rounds of household surveys, collected at three to five month intervals.  The final survey was collected after the end of the loan cycle.  Data collected included information on household demographics and conditions, income details, assets and expenditure details, indebtedness, savings and insurance details, as well as detailed information on cattle owned.  Researchers used the single difference estimation strategy when comparing results from a single time period, and used the information from all survey rounds in a pooled OLS to compare results over the total loan cycle.\r The analysis finds suggestive evidence of increased income for borrowers using the dairy-specific loan.  The main channel seems to be investment in a higher grade of dairy cattle.  However, the increase in income did not translate to higher household consumption.  There is also some evidence that both flexible repayment schedule loans led to better ability to deal with negative shocks.  For lending institutions, both the incidence and level of default increased.  However, circumstances in the microfinance industry in India at this time may indicate that these results are not generalizable.\r Take-up compliance was roughly 76%, with 18% of borrowers taking up no loan, and 6% noncompliance.  There was no differential attrition across treatments.  However, the response rate was significantly lower those that did not accept a loan.  This differential response rate makes it difficult to distinguish between compositional differences and incentive effects.  In addition, the experiment took place just prior to the “microcredit crisis” in India, further complicating interpretation.",

    "Abstract": "In response to the low payment compliance among individual taxpayers who previously reported their annual income tax returns indicating the obligation to pay monthly Article-25 income tax and the low responses when the tax office sent the reminders, we rolled out a behavioural nudge to increase responses and payment compliance. The nudge took the form of simplifying the notification letters presented by eliminating complicated languages and providing readily used biller codes was launched in expectation to change the payment and response rates. A pilot randomised controlled trial method was used to examine the effect of the intervention. The intervention was designed based on the status-quo letter modified, with the argumentation that the current reminder letter's design is tedious and potentially creates a psychological barrier on taxpayers' side to respond as expected by the tax office. We recruited 190 individual taxpayers registered at a tax office in Jakarta, Indonesia as the sample. The sample were randomised using simple randomisation technique. We expect the results of this pilot trial could be used to design larger experiment in the future as simplifying the existing written communication to the taxpayers is justifiably applied widely as one of the strategies to increase Indonesian taxpayers' compliance.",

    "Abstract": "Global e-commerce platforms present new export opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries by significantly lowering the entry barriers of exporting. However, the lack of market selection can lead to a large number of online firms competing for consumers' attention, resulting in severe congestion in consumers' search process. When firms' intrinsic quality is not perfectly observed, these search frictions can further slow down the resolution of the information problem and hinder market allocation towards better firms. In this paper, we investigate how search and information frictions shape firm dynamics and market evolution in global e-commerce. Using detailed data from AliEpxress as well as a rich set of self-collected objective quality measures, we provide stylized facts that are consistent with the presence of search and information frictions. Moreover, using a randomized experiment that offers exogenous demand and information shocks to small prospective exporters, we establish that firms with larger past sales have an advantage in overcoming the search friction and generating future orders. This indicates that initial demand shocks could confound firms' true quality in determining firm growth and the long-run market structure. We construct and estimate an empirical model of the online market that are consistent with our descriptive and experimental findings and use the model to quantify the extent of demand-side frictions. Counterfactual analyses show that alleviating information frictions and reducing the number of firms can help to improve allocative efficiency and raise consumer welfare.",

    "Experimental Design": "Prior to the start of the experiment, a baseline data collection was conducted in May 2018 that covers the majority of the product listings in the sector of children's t-shirts on AliExpress. We group the product listings into 4,640 distinct variety groups. We focus on the ``popular'' varieties with greater than 100 orders, aggregated across all stores, and sold by at least two ``small'' stores with fewer than 5 cumulative orders. This screening procedure enables us to create a treatment and control group of ``identical'' product listings. In total, 133 varieties satisfy the above criteria, containing 1,265 product listings from 638 stores.\r Of the 1,265 product listings, 790 are small listings with fewer than 5 orders. We randomize the 790 small listings into three groups of different order and review treatments: a control group C without any order and review treatment, T1 which receives 1 order randomly generated by the research team and a star rating, and T2, which, in addition to receiving an order and a star rating, further receives a detailed review on product and shipping quality.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A growing body of empirical work shows that social recognition of individuals' behavior can meaningfully influence individuals’ choices. This paper studies whether social recognition is a socially efficient lever for influencing individuals’ choices, relative to standard financial incentives. Because social recognition generates utility from esteem to some but disutility from shame to others, it can be either positive-sum, zero-sum, or negative-sum. This depends on whether the social recognition utility function is convex, linear, or concave, respectively. We develop a new revealed preferences methodology that allows us to investigate this question, as well as to structurally estimate leading models of social signaling and their equilibrium implications. We deploy the methods in a field experiment on promoting attendance to a YMCA health and fitness center.",

YMCA members of two large YMCA facilities from YOTA were invited via email to sign up to this program by completing a survey. They were informed that for every day that they attended the YMCA during the program month, an anonymous donor would make a $2 donation to their YMCA branch.  The survey also informed participants that they could become part of a second program—the “social recognition program” (SRP). Anyone enrolled in SRP would receive an email at the end of Grow &amp; Thrive revealing the attendance, and thus money generated, of every participant of SRP. ",

    "Experimental Design": "The online experiment consisted of three parts. Part one of the experiment began by explaining the nature of the incentives during the program. Participants were told that an anonymous benefactor with an interest in promoting healthy living and supporting the broader community provided funds to incentivize YOTA members to attend their local YMCA more frequently. During the month of the Grow &amp; Thrive program, a $2 donation was made on participants' behalf for each day a participant visited the YMCA, up to a total donation of $60 per person (e.g., 30 visits).\r In part two, participants were told that they might also be randomly selected to participate in SRP. We explained that if a participant was selected into this additional program, he/she would receive an email at the end of Grow &amp; Thrive, which would: (1) list the names of everyone in SRP; (2) list their attendance during Grow &amp; Thrive; and (3) list the total donations generated by them during Grow &amp; Thrive. We explained that only participants in SRP would receive and be listed in the email.\r We then elicited people's willingness to pay for receiving (or avoiding) social recognition (e.g., being part or not of the recognition program) using a combination of the strategy method and the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak elicitation method (BDM). The strategy-proof method contained 11 questions asking participants to state whether at the end of the program they wanted to participate in the social recognition program for different numbers of realized attendances during Grow &amp; Thrive, and then eliciting for each question how much they were willing to pay (between $0 and $8) to guarantee that their choice was implemented (the BDM component). The categories of possible visits were the following: 0 visits, 1 visits, 2 visits, 3 visits, 4 visits, 5 or 6 visits, 7 or 8 visits, 9 to 12 visits, 13 to 17 visits, 18 to 22 visits, and 23 or more visits.\r Each of the eleven questions had the following structure: “If I go X times to the YMCA during Grow &amp; Thrive I would prefer to participate (NOT participate) in the personal recognition program\". Participants were then asked to state, for each of the 11 levels of possible attendance, how much of the experimental budget of $8 they would be willing to give up to guarantee that their decision about social recognition was implemented. The wording was “You said you would rather be part (NOT be part) of the personal recognition program if you go X times to the YMCA. How much of the $8 reward would you give up to guarantee that you will indeed be part (NOT be part) of the personal recognition program?\" Although the procedure was involved, we told participants that, first and foremost, it was in their best interest to answer truthfully. The details were then explained in simple and plain language.\r To preserve random assignment, as well as to minimize any negative inferences that could be drawn about those not in the social recognition group, we guaranteed that the BDM responses would be used to determine assignment only with 10% chance. We explained to participants that they would have a 10% chance of receiving an additional $8 reward in the form of an Amazon gift card, the contents of which would be used to “pay” to implement their choices. If they were selected to be in that 10%, at the end of the experiment a computer would check how many times they actually attended the YMCA. The computer would then randomly choose a number between $0 and $8. If the computer chose a value smaller or equal to the amount they would give up to receive (or avoid) social recognition for the level of their actual attendance during the experiment, then their favorite decision about the SRP would be implemented. In this case, their extra reward would either be equal to $8 with 50% chance, or equal to $8 minus the amount chosen by the computer with 50% chance. If instead the computer chose a value larger than the amount that they would give up to receive/avoid social recognition, then their favorite decision would be implemented with only 50% probability and they would receive a reward of $8. Participants were also told that each draw for each participant is independent.\r From subjects' perspective, this procedure is equivalent to a second price sealed-bid auction against an unknown bidder. Note that providing a 50-50 chance to receive the desired option whenever random draws are above participants' bids was necessary, as otherwise participants would have had an incentive to misrepresent their true preferences in the first part of the “yes/no” elicitation and then simply bid zero.\r Because others' behavior plays a crucial role in social recognition payoffs it was important to ensure that participants had accurate beliefs about others' behavior. Prior to making their decisions about being part of the SRP, participants were therefore informed about the average attendance to their local YMCA during the prior month.\r Part three elicited participants' beliefs about their future attendance during Grow &amp; Thrive. We asked how many times they believed they would attend during the month of the experiment if: (1) they happened to be randomly selected to participate in the social recognition program; (2) they happened not to be selected to SRP; (3) if they happened not to be part of Grow &amp; Thrive (and consequently of SRP). Finally, we reminded participants that a computer would randomly determine whether they would be part of SRP, and we asked them to explicitly agree to participate in Grow &amp; Thrive.",

This information serves to set the experts' expectation on the readership of a typical Wikipedia article. In the high view condition, we provide the experts with the additional information on the number of views the recommended articles received in the past 30 days.\r Along the second dimension, we vary the experts' expectation on the amount of private benefit they receive from their contribution. We include three conditions: a baseline condition, a citation condition and an acknowledgement condition. The baseline condition serves as a control and no private benefit is mentioned in the email. In the citation condition, we mention that the articles recommended to the experts are likely to cite their research. The acknowledgement condition strengthens the private benefit by including acknowledgement as an additional benefit. The experts are told in the email message that their contributions will be addressed on a WikiProject Economics page at Wikipedia. WikiProject Economics is a collection of editors who work together as a team to improve articles related to economics.

    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "To measure the quality of the experts' contribution, we develop a rating protocol based on the guidance from the literature on examining peer review of manuscripts. The raters are expected to provide objective evaluations on the quality of the comments written by the experts. In our rating procedure, raters first read the associated Wikipedia article. For each piece of comment, raters start with a series of questions regarding various aspects of the comments prior to giving their overall ratings. Such a multi-item approach breaks down the global evaluation of the entire comment into concrete subcomponents and has been found to improve the inter-rate reliability for the overall quality rating.\r We measure the quality of comments by the median of raters' responses to each of the three questions:\r1. Please rate the overall quality of the comment.\r2. Suppose you are to incorporate this comment. How helpful is it?\r3. Suppose that you are to incorporate the expert's review of this Wikipedia article and you want to first break down the review into multiple comments. How many comments has the expert made to this Wikipedia article?",

    "Intervention(s)": "Participants in South Korea and the United States take part in an online survey experiment. Some participants are given information that supporters of different political parties perform equally well on factual knowledge questions, while others receive no such information. Afterwards, all participants answer a set of judgment tasks about facts and conspiracy theories, sometimes accompanied by signals about what partisan or educational groups believe. This setup allows us to test whether correcting perceptions about partisan knowledge influences people’s beliefs, information processing, and feelings toward political groups.",
    "Intervention (Hidden)": "The intervention is embedded in an online survey experiment administered to supporters of left- and right-wing parties in South Korea (Democratic Party of Korea, People Power Party) and the United States (Democratic Party, Republican Party). The study begins with questions on demographics, political attitudes, and baseline affective polarization, followed by two pre-treatment factual judgment tasks. After these tasks, half of the respondents are randomly assigned to the treatment group, which receives the information that the accuracy rates of right- and left-wing supporters on the pre-treatment tasks differ by less than 5%. The control group receives no such information.\r All respondents then complete post-treatment tasks. These include five judgment tasks with partisan signals (three factual, two conspiracy), in which respondents see either an in-party or out-party signal about majority supporter opinions. The signals are randomized at the respondent-task level. Respondents also complete two tasks with education signals (college vs. non-college majority opinion). Across tasks, participants judge the truthfulness of statements, rate their confidence, and guess the accuracy rates of in-group and out-group supporters. These outcomes allow estimation of treatment effects on disbelief, in-group bias in information processing, and affective polarization.\r The design further incorporates robustness and supplementary analyses, including: (i) effects on conspiracy theory questions, (ii) comparison with education group signals, (iii) exclusion of respondents showing experimenter demand effects (measured via changes in risk-attitude questions), and (iv) heterogeneity analyses by demographics and partisan groups. Sample restrictions are applied to respondents with baseline disbelief greater than 0.05, as treatment effects are expected primarily among those with initial bias. Power calculations indicate a target of ~4,252 respondents per country, based on pilot survey results from the United States.\r See the Pre-Analysis Plan for details",

    "Primary Outcomes (end points)": "Disbeliefs – Difference between estimated accuracy rates of in-group versus out-group supporters when judging factual statements.\r In-group bias in information processing – The Extent to which respondents update their judgments more when signals come from in-party members versus out-party members.\r Affective polarization – Difference in favorable versus unfavorable feelings toward in-party and out-party supporters, measured using feeling thermometers and comfort measures for social relations.",
    "Primary Outcomes (explanation)": "Disbeliefs: Constructed as the gap between respondents’ perceived accuracy of their own partisan in-group and the partisan out-group. We measure this before and after treatment to capture whether exposure to accurate information reduces out-group disbeliefs.\r In-group bias: Measured using post-treatment tasks (j = 3–5). Each respondent receives a randomized signal about either the in-party or out-party majority opinion. We compare updates in judgments (binary correctness and continuous confidence) across in-party versus out-party signal conditions.\r Affective polarization: Based on (i) 0–100 feeling thermometer ratings toward in-group and out-group supporters and (ii) binary comfort questions regarding out-party members in roles such as colleagues, friends, or spouses of children. The difference between in-party and out-party ratings forms the polarization measure.\r See the Pre-Analysis Plan for details",
    "Secondary Outcomes (end points)": "Disbeliefs about conspiracy theories – Changes in perceived knowledge gaps across partisan groups when evaluating conspiracy theory statements.\r In-group bias in processing conspiracy theory signals – Extent to which respondents weigh in-party versus out-party cues when exposed to partisan signals on conspiracy theories.\r Bias in information processing with education signals – Relative responsiveness to signals from college-educated versus non-college-educated groups.\r Experimenter demand effect – Sensitivity of responses to cues about the experimenter’s hypothesis (measured via repeated risk attitude questions).\r Heterogeneity of treatment effects – Variation in treatment impact by demographics (age, gender, partisan groups, etc.).",
    "Secondary Outcomes (explanation)": "Conspiracy disbeliefs: Constructed analogously to factual disbeliefs, but using tasks on conspiracy theories (j = 6, 7).\r In-group bias on conspiracy theories: Measured by how much respondents update their judgments after seeing in-party versus out-party majority positions on conspiracy questions.\r Education signals: Bias measured by comparing belief updates after signals from college vs. non-college groups (tasks j = 8, 9).\r Experimenter demand: Identified by changes in responses to risk-attitude questions when experimenter hypotheses are made explicit; used to exclude affected respondents in robustness checks.\r Heterogeneity: Examined by estimating treatment and bias outcomes across subgroups defined by demographics and partisan groups.",
    "Experimental Design": "We conduct a randomized online survey experiment in South Korea and the United States. Participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. The treatment group receives information that supporters of different political parties perform equally well on factual knowledge questions, while the control group receives no information. After this, participants complete judgment tasks on factual and conspiracy statements, sometimes paired with signals about the majority views of partisan or education groups. This design allows us to test whether correcting perceptions of partisan knowledge influences beliefs, information processing, and affective polarization.",
    "Experimental Design Details": "The experiment begins with baseline questions on demographics, political attitudes, and affective polarization, followed by two pre-treatment factual judgment tasks. Respondents are then randomly split: the treatment group is informed that partisan groups differ by less than 5% in accuracy on the factual questions, while the control group receives no information.\r Post-treatment, all respondents complete five additional judgment tasks (three factual, two conspiracy), where each task randomly assigns them either an in-party or out-party signal regarding majority opinions. They also complete two additional tasks with education signals (college vs. non-college). In each task, respondents provide a true/false judgment, confidence rating, and estimates of partisan accuracy.\r These tasks enable estimation of (i) treatment effects on out-group disbelief, (ii) in-group bias in information processing, and (iii) changes in affective polarization. Supplementary analyses assess the processing of conspiracy theories, compare partisan versus education signals, account for experimenter demand effects, and test heterogeneity by demographics and partisanship.",
    "Randomization Method": "Randomization is conducted by computer within the survey platform.

A Guatemalan microfinance lender gradually started using a credit bureau across its branches without letting borrowers know about it. One year later, we ran a large randomized credit information course that described the existence and workings of the bureau to the clients of this lender. This pairing of natural and randomized experiments allows us to separately identify how new information enters on the supply and the demand sides of the market. Our results indicate that the credit bureau generated large efficiency gains for the lender, and that these gains were augmented when borrowers understood the rules of the game. The credit bureau rewarded good borrowers but penalized weaker ones, increasing economic differentiation.",

In August 2001, a major microfinance lender began to install hardware permitting branches to communicate information with the bureau, but did not inform borrowers of the use of the bureau. A randomized training campaign was conducted in which 5000 borrowers were informed of the use of the system, how the bureau worked, and the opportunities and risks it presented for them. Institutional data from the lender and bureau was then used to track how a variety of lending outcomes emerged from this structure in which asymmetric information was reduced on the two sides of the market at two different points in time. It was thus possible to disentangle the supply- and demand-side impacts of credit market information, and identify separately the roles of adverse selection, moral hazard, and incentives on group composition.",

        "Abstract": "We utilize a unique pair of experiments to isolate the ways in which reductions in asymmetric information alter credit market outcomes. A Guatemalan microfinance lender gradually started using a credit bureau across its branches without letting borrowers know about it. One year later, we ran a large randomized credit information course that described the existence and workings of the bureau to the clients of this lender. This pairing of natural and randomized experiments allows us to separately identify how new information enters on the supply and the demand sides of the market. Our results indicate that the credit bureau generated large efficiency gains for the lender, and that these gains were augmented when borrowers understood the rules of the game. The credit bureau rewarded good borrowers but penalized weaker ones, increasing economic differentiation.",

    "Abstract": "Study Design: Experimental Controlled Laboratory Study\rObjective: To assess the effects of cryotherapy on muscular fatigability of the biceps brachii (BB) muscle after a fatiguing exercise.\rBackground: Cryotherapy has been widely used in clinical sports practice to prevent Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) and its known consequences on muscular function: pain, fatigue, reduced capacity to generate force and a reduced performance. Evidence is limited regarding the myolectrical manifestations of fatigue after the use of cryotherapy.\rMethods: 50 subjects were randomized into two groups: cryotherapy (CRYO) and a control (CONT). Both groups were exposed to a fatiguing concentric-eccentric exercise protocol of the BB muscle.  Immediately after the protocol, a -17°C cold pack was applied over the BB muscle in the CRYO group for 20 minutes. A 22°C cold pack was applied as a placebo intervention to the control group. Pain, time to task failure, myoelectrical manifestations of fatigue, and swelling were assessed before, 1h and 24h after the exercise protocol.\rResults: There were no significant differences between groups in any of the outcome measurements. However, within group comparisons showed significantly lower holding time and higher levels of pain at 1h assessment in the CONT group.  Myoelectrical manifestations of fatigue behaved similarly in both groups.\rConclusion: Cryotherapy seems to reduce the mechanical effects of fatigue and seems to prevent the excessive increase in pain in the first few hours after a fatiguing protocol. However, no effect on myoletrical manifestations of fatigue were observed.\r",

Many people confuse the seasonal influenza with a simple cold. However, the “real” influenza in contrast to the simple cold, can lead to severe complications, such as heart muscle and lung infections. The people who are the most vulnerable to contracting the seasonal influenza and whose health can negatively affect the severity of the infection, are in many cases not healthy enough to get vaccinated. Therefore, they rely on herd immunity.\r Vaccinating is the single most effective way to protect people that rely on herd immunity. It is key to have the seasonal influenza vaccination rate as high as possible due to the limited effectiveness of the vaccination. Therefore, it is essential that as many people as possible get vaccinated. According to a study conducted by Spanish scientists, a rate of approximately 85% is needed to protect the ones who rely on herd immunity.\r The overall population of the Kanton Zurich has an influenza vaccination rate of approximately 16% which is equal to the vaccination rate of the employees at the University of Zurich. This is surprising, since the employees, in contrast to most of the rest of the population, can get vaccinated for free.” \r  [COVID-19] “Discussing the potential connection between influenza vaccination and the covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic, Dr. Albert Ko, a professor and department chair at the Yale School of Public Health, said the following:\r “I do think immunizing people against influenza has a very important indirect effect,\"\r(https://www.livescience.com/getting-flu-shot-help-coronavirus-outbreak.html)\r He further explains that reducing the amount of influenza infections can “relieve pressure” from hospitals also treating patients with covid-19.”\r",

    "Abstract": "Irrigation investments have enormous potential to improve the lives of smallholder farmers who otherwise depend on rain-fed agriculture, through increasing yields, adding additional cultivating seasons, and reducing risk. Realizing these benefits often requires smallholders to simultaneously coordinate operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the irrigation infrastructure and shift agricultural technologies. As a result, many of these investments are wasted due either to public goods market failures or limited adoption of new agricultural techniques. We simultaneously experimentally vary governance structures, access to complementary agricultural technologies, and the rollout of taxes on usage of the system within hillside irrigation schemes in Rwanda to test these hypothesized barriers to efficiency. Moreover, we exploit both a spatial discontinuity in the boundary of the schemes to evaluate the overall impact of access to irrigation. Lastly, we use variation in the nature of spillovers from both coordinating O&amp;M and technology adoption driven by the size and composition of water user groups and the location of smallholder plots within each water user group to identify model driven effect heterogeneity.",
