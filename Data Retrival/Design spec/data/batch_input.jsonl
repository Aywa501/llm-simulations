Only one round is payoff relevant. At the beginning of each round, all participants of each group are randomly matched in pairs. Participants know they are matched with a new random participant from the group of 15 every round.\n In each round, there are 100 items of type A and 100 items of type B to split. \nFor type A, participants have outside options, i.e., the number of items of type A they will receive in the case of bargaining failure. Subjects know that the outside options vi could be any number between 0 and 100 with equal probability and are drawn independently for each subject.\n The outside options for the type B object are equal to 0 for both subjects, and they know it. However, each subject has a different multiplier for the points of type B. Multiplier is drawn independently for each subject from the uniform distribution between [0.7,1.3]. Subjects know their multiplier for the round and the distribution. \n Finally, the market could either with or without deal-breaking for type A items. In markets with deal-breaking, subjects receive zero points if they end up with fewer A type items than their outside option. Subjects know that the presence of a deal-breaking property is the same for all subjects in the round. The utility function for each round is presented. To simplify the setup, subjects will play the first ten rounds under no deal-breaking, followed by 10 rounds of deal-breaking, or in the reversed order. We will balance the order. We will remind subjects of the switch in the utility function after round 10.\n This corresponds to no information treatment of Bochet et al. 2023.\n Under this parametrization, in expectation, 28% of markets have a surplus large enough to reach efficiency even in one-dimensional bargaining (the sum of outside options is less than 75). 22% of the markets have a small surplus and cannot reach an agreement despite a positive surplus from bargaining (the sum of outside options is between 75 and 100). 50% of the markets have no surplus, as the sum of outside values is higher than 100. This implies that, in expectation, we will have 22 hard markets\n The deal-breaking property affects the utility function of subjects. Under no deal-breaking, a subject’s payoff for the round is\n U_i=A_i+w_i*B_i\nwhere A_i is agreed amount of type A items or v_i if agreement is not reached. B_i is agreed amount of the type B item or 0 is agreement is not reached.\n Under deal-breaking a subject’s payoff for the round is\nU_i=A_i+w_i*B_i if A_i≥v_i, or 0 if A_i<v_i \nwhere A_i is agreed amount of type A items or v_i if agreement is not reached. B_i is agreed amount of the type B item or 0 if agreement is not reached. Thus, accepting an offer of type A item below outside option leads to zero payoff from type A items.\n The points collected in U are transformed in euros with exchange rate of 10 cents per 1 point.\n Treatments.\nWe have 3x2 between-subject design.\n One issue Two issues\nFree bargaining (Barg).

The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. The experiment was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five treatment arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Within each of these groups, half were assigned to receive a small subsidy and half a large subsidy.\n This part of the study includes 170 schools assigned to Arms 1, 2, and 3. Once schools were allocated to one of these treatment arms, the principal of each school receiving a small incentive, a large incentive, or no incentive for reducing anemia prevalence in their schools.\n Comparison group: In 65 schools, principals did not receive any incentive to reduce anemia; they received only budget support and information. (Arm 1 of the original trial)\n Large performance incentives: In 65 schools, principals received a larger incentive of 125 yuan (US$20) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. Under this incentive structure, it was feasible for principals in this group to earn incentives equivalent to two additional months of salary. (Arm 2 of the original trial)\n Small performance incentives: In 40 schools, principals received 12.5 Chinese yuan (US$2) for each student who was anemic at the start of the intervention and no longer anemic at the end. (Arm 3 of the original trial)\n Across each of the three incentive groups, all schools were randomly assigned to receive small or large black grants in order to examine the effect of different amounts of resources on the prevalence of anemia. Although these funds were given in the context of the nutrition program, principals were free to reallocate them to other school functions, and receiving these funds did not depend on reducing anemia prevalence.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThis study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” In the original trial, researchers began with 36 counties officially designated by the Chinese government as “poverty counties” in five regions (prefectures) in western China (Haidong in Qinghai Province, Dingxi, Tianshui, and Longnan in Gansu Province, and Ankang in Shaanxi Province). In August 2011, researchers conducted a canvass survey in each county to construct a list of all rural primary schools and the number of students enrolled in each. Restricting the sampling frame to primary schools with 150-300 students total, they randomly selected 300 of 1,410 eligible schools for inclusion in the study (and limited selection to one school per township). The sample size was based on power calculations conducted using data from primary schools in the same region of China. Within study schools, researchers randomly sampled 50 fourth and fifth grade students from each school (10-to-11-year-old students). Researchers chose these grades to select students sufficiently old to provide meaningful survey responses – but also sufficiently young to be generally prepubescent. Researchers conducted physical exams and collected data from students from other grades at baseline to obfuscate the focus on fourth and fifth graders.\n The original experiment was designed as a cluster-randomized trial using a 5x2 crosscutting design. After conducting the baseline survey, researchers provided all school administrators with information about anemia, and schools were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental cells. The five incentive groups arms were: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). The planned methodology and specifications for analyzing the impacts of the program are outlined in the Pre-Analysis Plan. Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. \n This part of the study includes only Arm 1, referred to as Group A: a group without incentives; Arm 2, referred to as Group C: a “large” incentive group; and Arm 3, referred to as Group B: a “small” incentive group. As noted, each of these arms has two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group (Group 1: 85 schools; Group A1: 32 schools; Group B1: 20 schools; Group C1: 33 schools) and a “large” block grant group (Group 2: 85 schools; Group A2: 33 schools; Group B2: 20 schools; Group C2: 32 schools). The reference group is the default policy (education about anemia coupled with a modest resource transfer and no incentives, Group A1). To improve power, researches used stratified randomization. Using joint quintiles of the baseline distribution of school-level hemoglobin concentration and combined standardized math and Chinese exam scores – yielding 25 strata, researchers randomized cell assignment within each stratum. This analysis takes this randomization procedure into account, conditioning on stratum fixed effects. \n In the large incentive group - Group C - researchers offered school administrators financial incentives to be paid as private income according to the net reduction in number of students identified as anemic between the beginning and end of the school year, with 125 yuan (RMB) ($19.40) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., two months of a school administrator’s annual salary for a 50-percent reduction in anemia). Researchers did not reveal the identity of anemic students. The small incentive group - Group B - was identical to the Group C except that the incentive was 12.5 RMB ($1.95) per student reduction in anemia (i.e., 0.2 additional months of annual salary for 50-percent reduction in anemia). When school administrators signed incentive contracts, they were told the (implied) number of anemic students in their schools (student identity was not revealed). Contracts were written using official letterhead of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (a government agency) and counter-signed by the deputy director of the implementing research center (school administrators signed two copies of the contract, one of which they kept). All interventions were implemented in partnership with local education bureaus, signaling that the project was sanctioned by local governments.\n The small block grant group - Group 1 - was 0.3 RMB ($0.05) per student per day for school administrators to purchase vitamins for each student to take daily. The large block grant - Group 2 - was 0.7 RMB ($0.11) per student per day. In total, Group 1 schools received 7,452 yuan ($1,164) on average and Group 2 schools received 17,388 yuan ($2,717). These grants were given to schools in two installments (at the beginning of the program and half way through the school year). Although funds were given in the context of nutrition, administrators were free to allocate these to other school functions at their discretion.\n Prior to revealing treatment assignment, researchers provided health education about nutrition and anemia to all school administrators in the study. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011 and follow-up survey in May 2012 (i.e., at the beginning and end of the 2011-2012 academic year), collecting detailed information on students, households, school administrators, and schools. As part of Student Surveys, researchers interviewed all sampled students at their schools, collecting information on student background, health behaviors related to anemia, school activities, and general health. Students were given standard food frequency questionnaires to collect information about food consumption at school and at home over the past week. Researchers measured student blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at the time of the student survey. Nurses from the Medical School of Xi’an Jiaotong University accompanied study enumerators, collecting finger-prick blood samples to analyze on-site (at schools) using HemoCue Hb 201+ assessment systems. As part of Household Surveys, for each sampled student, researchers collected information about interactions between parents and the school, household income and assets, health-related expenditures, expenditures on food and information on other household members, focusing on household characteristics that students would be unlikely to know themselves. As part of School Administrator Surveys, researchers interviewed school administrators (bureaucrats) at three different points in time: before and after school administrators were told about the incentive contract and block grant to which they were assigned and again at endline. At baseline, school administrators provided information about their background, job history, salary, and compensation as well as perceptions of professional responsibilities and anemia knowledge. Researchers also measured the intrinsic and pro-social motivation of administrators. Following their participation in the training session on anemia (conducted 3 weeks after the baseline survey) administrators were given a second short survey to measure their understanding of the training material. Through School Surveys, researchers collected basic information from schools (enrollment, staffing, facilities, finances, and meal provision) and teachers (teacher characteristics, communication with parents, and teaching practices).\n For primary outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and a dichotomous indicator for anemia status), researchers test eight null hypotheses: five for treatment main effects and their interactions and three additional ones – that the small and large incentives have the same average effect, that the large incentive and the large block grant have the same average effect, and that the average effect of the large incentive in presence of a large grant is zero. Therefore researchers adjust p-values to control the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) using the free step-down resampling method of Westfall and Young (1993), which accounts for the dependency of the data. For secondary outcomes, researchers adjust p-values according to the total number of tests within a family of outcomes (the number of outcomes in the family times five – the number of treatment coefficients in each regression). Secondary outcomes are behavioral responses underlying changes in primary outcomes (actions taken by administrators (provision of supplements or food and communication with households) and subsequent responses among students and their parents (student consumption of iron-rich foods, direct iron supplementation, communication between parents and schools about anemia and its nutritional basis).\n Finally, researchers examine the cost-effectiveness of each intervention combination, considering both the sub-sample of children anemic at baseline and the full sample of children, and present both “programmatic” cost-effectiveness (direct monetary program costs to the implementing organization) and social cost-effectiveness calculations. Researchers calculate total social costs as the sum of programmatic costs, the cost of public funds, and costs incurred by households in response to the interventions. \n As noted earlier, the full experiment involved 300 schools. The remaining 130 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M.

Therefore, we randomize two treatments that are meant to inform parents about the SEP and the wider range of educational options that they can access thanks to the program. \n The first treatment is the provision of a report card designed for each preschool that includes information about the SEP and a list with all the secondary schools located in the same neighborhood, their addresses, telephone numbers and a map with their locations. In order to reinforce the idea that the SEP increases educational options for low socioeconomic parents, the schools' list is divided in three groups \"schools that are free for anyone\" , \"schools that are free for SEP students\" and \"schools that charge fees\" . The objective is to strengthen the idea that SEP students can now attend “schools that are free for SEP students” without paying.\n The second treatment is the provision of the same report card, but it includes extra information on schools' characteristics: (i) test scores, (ii)a measure of the change in test scores between years, (iii) the official tuition cost for SEP and non SEP parents, (iv) the type of school (i.e. whether it is public or private) and (v) weather it has preschool and high school.\n Parents in the control group are also given a report card that includes a flyer highlighting the importance of choosing the right school for their children and a list with all the secondary schools in their neighborhood, their addresses, telephone numbers and a map with their locations. The objective of this report card is to act as a placebo.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe implement an encouragement design in order to estimate the impact of the Subvencion Escolar Preferencial (SEP).

Randomization is done at the preschool level in order to avoid contamination among treated and control parents attending a same preschool. Randomizing at the preschool level also facilitates the implementation of the program, given that report cards are delivered through the preschools.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nSchool Choice and Educational Outcomes\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Mothers accessed these pre-recorded audio lessons via Interactive Voice Response (IVR) by dialing a toll-free number. The audio lessons featured pre-recorded conversations among four characters: two teachers and two students. During the conversations, students were asked to do some activities according to the teachers’ instructions, such as clapping, standing up, counting, and making plans. The teachers used regular pauses and cues, as well as playing music and songs during the recorded lessons to assist the children in completing similar tasks with the help of their mothers. Overall, these modules were developed to supplement the national curriculum and support learning in household settings during the pandemic led school closure.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe will use original sampling design where 90 villages were randomly selected from a list of 140 villages (out of 223 villages from ECD program) and each of the 90 participating villages randomly distributed into one of three groups, i.e., Standard group, Extended group, and Control group (Wang et al., 2024). However, for this study, we merged these two treatment groups into one as mothers from both treatment groups received similar intervention.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nStudy participants: Participants of the IVR program by Wang et al. (2024) were recruited in early 2021 from a list of households previously involved in Global Development & Research Initiative Foundation (GDRI)’s pre-pandemic early childhood development project (hereinafter, ECD program). ECD program introduces and evaluates alternative models of early childhood interventions—traditional kindergarten and home visits—that can be effectively scaled for implementation. A large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in rural communities to assess the efficacy of three approaches: a preschool program, the program combined with a parent academy, and the program integrated with home visits. The first intervention established a preschool program, the second included weekly home visits by teachers or caregivers to facilitate parent-child interactions and enhance the home learning environment, and the third combined the preschool program with home visits. The research involved around 7,000 children from 223 villages in southwestern Bangladesh. ECD program’s endline was completed in early 2019. Many children who were involved in ECD program were in primary school in early 2021, making them suitable candidates for IVR intervention.\n Participant recruitment process: In early 2021, a subsample of villages for IVR intervention were identified from 223 villages with prior participation in ECD program. GDRI, as the partner organization for IVR program, provided this village list. Crucially, GDRI was instructed to restrict the list of eligible households in these villages that: (a) had active phone numbers and 1-4 graders; (b) were initially willing to participate; and (c) were not involved in any interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to budget constraints, 90 villages were selected and then randomized into one of two treatments (i.e., Standard and Extended treatments) and a control group. Anticipating potential attrition, a rapid baseline survey was conducted for approximately 2,400 eligible participants. Within each village, eligible households were randomly selected. This step narrowed the sample down to approximately 1,900 households. Some further attrition occurred after before the intervention began. The final sample included 596 participants in the Standard treatment group, 586 in the Extended treatment group, and 581 in the control group.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThis study aims to assess the long-term spillover effects of providing educational contents to children via mothers using low-tech, highly accessible mobile technology. We will assess whether this intervention enhances women’s connectivity over time, agency, gender attitude and leading to increased empowerment. The primary outcomes are -, Digital Connectivity: The Digital Connectivity will quantify the extent of household access to digital technologies among rural Bangladeshi mothers, reflecting their potential for digital engagement in low-resource settings., Agency: By following Kabeer (1999), we conceptualize mothers’ agency through a process through which the mothers make strategic decisions, exert control over their material, human and social resources, and move with freedom, particularly in ways related to their children’s education and their digital connectivity, which is largely restricted by several socio-cultural norms in Bangladeshi society., Gender Attitude Index (GAI): Gender Attitude Index (GAI), an indicator of social norm, will be measured following the method outlined by Dhar et al. (2022). It is designed to capture attitudes towards gender roles, embracing the conception of equality and the more patriarchal concept., Digital Literacy Transfer Index (DLTI): Digital Literacy Transfer Index measures the degree to which mothers introduce newly acquired digital competencies to other family members, particularly children, focusing on their behavioral shifts and role as agents of new technologies within households., Economic Empowerment: Economic Empowerment will be measured in light of the Five Domains of Empowerment (5DE) framework from the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which assesses empowerment across five key domains: Production, Resources, Income, Leadership, and Time.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nChildren’s educational status: Educational status of the children will be measured to identify whether there is any gender heterogeneity after receiving tech-based distance learning in the long run. We will measure this by using survey questions and a brief assessment test., Homeschooling: Homeschooling by mothers will be assessed through a series of survey questions designed to capture various aspects of their involvement in their children’s education. These questions will explore the amount of time mothers invest in teaching their children at home, the types of educational activities they engage in, the frequency and duration of these activities., Educational Aspirations for Children: Educational aspirations will be assessed based on the academic and professional goals that mothers establish for their children, in accordance with theoretical frameworks on maternal education’s influence on child development (Behrman et al., 1999) and sociocultural factors shaping parental aspirations (Yamamoto and Holloway, 2010).\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

This is designed to increase the salience of an individual’s beliefs about the future benefits of physical activity and to improve their connection to their future-self. \n Intervention Two - Consideration & Connection & Commitment Group (C&C&C). This intervention combines the Consideration and Connection intervention with the Commitment task.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nA three (equal) arm randomised control trial comparing the effectiveness of Consideration & Connection (C&C) and Consideration, Connection & Commitment (C&C&C) compared to a control group.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nThe trial will be run online through a Qualtrics interface. The recruitment literature will have a link to this interface and interested individuals will be able to access the website. \nInformation, Consent and Eligibility\nOnce participants have accessed the initial section of the Qualtrics interface they will be given more information on the study and then be asked to give consent. Following on from this eligibility will be ascertained by answering self-report questions. Activity levels will be derived from answering questions adapted from the short self-administered form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (https://sites.google.com/site/theipaq/). Vigorous minutes will be multiplied by two to give moderate minutes. Participants will be ineligible if they are typically active for more than 70 minutes per week. Participants will also be asked how old they are, whether they are already taking part in a physical activity program, whether they are willing and able to undertake a walking plan and whether they are able to send and receive email messages. They will also be asked if they know of any other reason why they should not engage in physical activity.\nThe interface will terminate with a suitable thank you message at this point for ineligible participants and no data will be retained.\nThe Qualtrics interface will trigger a notification email for study administration purposes at this point for all eligible participants who complete the initial survey.\nRandomisation and Blinding\nOnce consent has been given and eligibility has been established participants will be randomised to one of the three groups (Control, Consideration & Connection and Consideration & Connection & Commitment) through a Qualtrics computer generated sequence.\nIt will not be possible to carry out full blinding of the participants as those who receive the intervention will be aware of the contents of the intervention. As it is essentially a trial run by one person it will also be difficult to blind the researcher about the assignments to the various groups.\nBaseline Measurement\nAfter randomisation participants will be issued with an activity pack that contains a pedometer, instructions on how to operate the pedometer, instructions about how to record baseline activity and a diary for recording baseline step counts (see appendix).\nBaseline will be assessed by instructing the participant to wear the pedometer all day (not just when they go for a walk), every day for one week. The participant will record the step count from each of those days in the diary. They will then report these values as part of the main data collection. \nMain Trial Period\nOnce participants have complete the procedure of taking baseline activity measures they will return to the interface to report their baseline activity. At this stage they will be asked to complete various questions relating to the outcome measures required. After that those randomised to the Consideration & Connection and Consideration & Connection & Commitment groups will perform various intervention tasks (see appendix).\nThe Qualtrics system will trigger an email to a study administration with details of the participant and their baseline step count. This will allow a personalised walking plan to be produced.\nThe personalised, progressive walking plan will then be posted to the participant (see appendix). Those in the Consideration & Connection & Commitment group will also receive instructions about accessing stickK.com (see appendix). The walking plan will consist of daily targets for each week. These targets will be based upon their baseline step count and aimed at increasing their weekly step count to at least 15000 steps per week by the end of the intervention period (4 weeks). (For the first week their daily target will be average daily baseline step count (adbs) + 750 steps; for week two adbs + 1500 steps and for week three and four adbs + 2250 steps.) The final four weeks of the plan will consist of a maintenance phase of attempting to achieve at least 15000 steps per week. (i.e. adbs + at least 2250 steps).\nThe rationale behind aiming for this increase over baseline is that walking at least 15000 steps per week would bring the participant into line with the recommended minimum guidelines of 150 minutes (on the assumption that 3000 steps equate to 30 minutes (Marshall, Levy et al. 2009)) of moderate exercise a week (UK Government 2011).\nDuring the intervention period (four weeks) participants will report daily step counts on a weekly basis through Qualtrics. Those in the Consideration & Connection group and the Consideration & Connection & Commitment group will also review the effect on their future-selves of their current week’s activity levels.\nAt the end of the intervention period (four weeks) and again at the end of the maintenance phase (a further four weeks) participants will be administered physical activity report questions based on the short self-report IPAQ questionnaire (https://sites.google.com/site/theipaq/).\nAt the end of the study) participants will report step counts, complete follow up repeat measures and be asked follow up qualitative questions through the Qualtrics interface. The purpose of the responses in the free text boxes is to provide further information to inform the discussion of the results of the research. If step count reporting has been incomplete the follow up questionnaire will be distributed once the remaining duration of the walking plan has elapsed.\nParticipants will be sent one prompt and two reminder emails via the Qualtrics interface at each stage of the study. Confirmation of posting emails will be sent once the activity and diary packs have been posted. Participants will receive an Amazon voucher for £15 on completion of the final follow-up questionnaire. Participants will be allowed to retain the pedometers. These strategies are intended to maximise retention rates, data gathering and adherence to the intervention protocol.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe primary outcome is increase in step count over baseline at four and eight weeks.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

These elicitations are incentivised by using methods similar to Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) to report the subjective probability of prizes and their willingness to accept to sell the lotteries (see the enclosed documents for more details).\n There are two main treatments: \n In the control treatment: Subjects observe 20 draws from a urn containing 50 prizes of 100 experimental units and 50 prizes of 20 Experimental units and they are explicitly told that they urn contains two and only two prizes. They need to report the subjective probabilities of the two prizes and their willingness to accept for selling the lottery determined by a random draw from the urn.\n In the surprise treatment: Subjects observe 20 draws from a urn -- that we call \"original urn\" containing 50 prizes of 100 experimental units and 50 prizes of 20 Experimental units. They are asked to report the subjective probabilities of the two prizes and their willingness to accept for selling the lottery determined by a random draw from the original urn. Then we add to the original urn -- that we call now \"updated\" urn -- 50 prizes of E experimental units and we ask subjects to observe a new draw from the updated urn. This is a non random draw featuring the prize E. Subjects after observing E, and without other information are asked again to report the subjective probabilities of the two prizes and their willingness to accept for selling the lottery determined by a random draw from the modified urn.\n In the surprise treatment we further distinguish two different sub-treatments one where the prizes added is E = 200 units - the good surprise treatment; and the other where the prizes added is E = 10 units - the bad surprise treatment. \n We plan to run this experiment online by using the Amazon MTurk platform\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n(i) The subjective probability of an impossible event (or prize) in the original urn for treated group, (ii) The subjective probability of an impossible event (or prize) in the updated urn for treated group, (iii) The ratio between subjective probabilities of the prizes 20 and 100 respectively in the original urn for the treated group, (iv) The ratio between subjective probabilities of the prizes 20 and 100 respectively in the updated urn for the treated group, (v) The ratio between subjective probabilities of the prizes 20 and 100 respectively in the urn for the control group, (vi) The willingness to accept to sell the original lottery in the treated group, (vii) The willingness to accept to sell the updated lottery in the treated group, (viii) The willingness to accept to sell the lottery in the control group\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The providers then decided which training sessions, if any, their staff would participate in. Supportive supervision services, and other complementary services were also offered.\n2) Control: Private health providers were not offered any elements of the training package or complimentary services.\n Since each private health provider independently chose which training sessions and complimentary services to take advantage of, our analysis employs an “intent-to-treat” approach to examine the impact of offering the multi-faceted intervention, regardless of participation in the training sessions.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThis study used a randomized controlled trial research design, with a baseline survey (prior to randomization) and an endline survey of the 965 private healthcare facilities. We randomly assigned those 965 private health facilities into either a treatment group (484 facilities) or a control group (481 facilities) using the following steps for stratification: First, we created strata for each of the 20 local government areas, or LGA, creating 20 “primary cells.” We made sure that each cell contained at least four facilities in order to avoid sparsely populated cells. Second, we created sub-strata. This was done as follows. For primary cells with more than 16 facilities, we created sub-strata by splitting the primary strata into those above and below the median vignette score (defined below) and, within each of the resulting sub-strata, splitting again into those above and below the median business score . Thus, we created “final cells,” which were groupings of facilities from the same LGA and, if the sample size permitted, were also similar in terms of the vignette score and business score. Finally, we randomly assigned all 965 facilities, one by one within each of those ‘final cells’ to either a control or treatment group.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nHealthcare: the range of contraceptive methods offered, overall quality of counseling services, provider interpersonal skills, provider overall knowledge., Business Practices: record-keeping, loan applications, current loans, revenue generation.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

To begin, we tackled the issue of job suitability by collecting job opportunities at the village, district, and governorate levels. These jobs were then classified into different categories. Next, we gathered data from job seekers and their parents to match their needs, qualifications, and interests with suitable job opportunities. The objective of this step was to provide tailored job matches while addressing information barriers as effectively as possible.\nBy offering these job opportunities at the household level, we sought to mitigate additional challenges such as financial barriers, uncertainty about the jobs, and the risk of sexual harassment during transportation. Collecting data separately from youth and their parents allowed us to identify any gaps in expectations regarding the types of jobs and the associated requirements for youth versus their parents.\nSubsequently, we presented job opportunities to the youth in stages: first to the youth alone, then in the presence of their fathers, and finally in the presence of their mothers. This approach enabled us to explore the role of parental involvement in the decision-making process and its impact on job acceptance. Assigning youth to each group with random on households, individual level. \nAt a later stage, we randomised the offering of jobs to youth alone versus another group that included both parents. The objective was to compare the outcomes of offering jobs to youth alone, offering jobs to youth along with their fathers, and offering jobs to youth along with their mothers. To further examine the impact of involving both parents, we also randomised the offering of jobs to youth alone versus offering jobs to youth with the inclusion of both parents.\nSelection criteria: \n1- Age: 18-35 years. \n2- Employment: Unemployed and interested in work \n3- Parents: the presence of both parents in the house\n4- 50% of the sample females as much as we could\n5- If we have male and female within the same household, we choose one gender, which we pick randomly \nThe Randomization will be divided into two separate experiments that will be combined in the analysis phase:\n The first experiment will include: \n • Youth alone (no parental involvement).\n • Youth + fathers (father involvement).\n • Youth + mothers (mother involvement).\n • Youth control (control group with no intervention).\nThe second experiment will include: \n • Youth alone (no parental involvement).\n • Youth + both parents (both parents involved).\n • Youth control (control group with no intervention).\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nIn our experiment, we aimed to address all these challenges comprehensively.

Customers will thus be offered the same instrumental services: the only thing differing is whether the services are included in their present relatively nondescript card, or on the premium card which might have an additional \"social status\" component. If the share accepting the premium card is higher than the share accepting the added benefits to the non-premium card, we will have established that customers value the status associated with the exclusive premium card. \nTo understand what drives the demand for social status, we interact this treatment with a second one. Before being made the offer, customers in a control group are asked to name their favorite TV channel, while customers in a treatment group are asked to describe an event in their life that made them feel successful. According to the literature in psychology, this treatment can (at least temporarily) increase the self-esteem of the customers. We will thus be able to analyze whether the demand for social status is higher (lower) among customers with higher self-esteem, and thus understand whether self-image and social-image are complements or substitutes.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nCustomers will be randomly assigned into one of the following groups: (1) premium card and self-esteem question, (2) premium card and TV question, (3) non-premium card and self-esteem question, and (4) non-premium card and TV question.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nPrimary Outcome: offer take-up decision\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

In recent years, harsh winter conditions have led to substantial livestock mortality and significantly impacted exposed pastoralists’ socioeconomic well-being. In reaction, steps towards an early warning system have been undertaken. Since 2015, Mongolia’s Information and Research Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology, and Environment (IRIMHE) has released geographic risk projections for extreme winter conditions during the early winter. These risk maps are utilized as a trigger in several anticipatory humanitarian assistance programs implemented by international organizations, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and FAO. As soon as a pre-determined risk level is reached, humanitarian assistance is disbursed to at-risk households to prevent or reduce acute humanitarian impacts before they fully materialize. The early distribution is intended to make humanitarian assistance more effective and cost-efficient than conventional humanitarian disaster relief.\n The intervention evaluated in this study is an unconditional cash transfer distributed to pastoralist households in Western Mongolia in March 2021. The cash transfer targets households in areas projected to be at very high, high, or medium risk of experiencing extreme winter conditions in the risk map released on January 10, 2021. Cash transfers to 421 households were financed by the German Federal Foreign Office. The average value of the cash transfer is 236 USD. The value of the cash transfer is informed by existing anticipatory humanitarian action programs in Mongolia, amounting to approximately 1.7 months of working for the national minimum wage or the market price of four sheep at the time of the intervention. \n The distribution of the cash transfers was implemented by the INGO People in Need (PIN) and follows an experimental design that allows for a rigorous impact evaluation. The assistance was disbursed through bank transfers. A pre-intervention survey ascertained that the potential needs of vulnerable people concerning accessing local bank branches were identified and could be addressed. Immediately after the bank transactions were completed, PIN informed recipient households via phone call or text message that they received the transfers.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe impact evaluation builds on the Coping with Shocks in Mongolia Household Panel Survey (Kraehnert et al. 2022), which has been implemented in 3 western provinces (Govi-Altai, Zavkhan, and Uvs) of Mongolia since 2012. The initial sample comprises 1,768 households. Data from wave 4, collected between June 2020 and May 2021, serves as baseline data. Data from wave 5, collected between June 2021 and May 2022, serves as endline data. \n The relevant population for the cash transfer intervention is households that fulfill three eligibility criteria: i) they must be sample households of the Coping with Shocks in Mongolia Household Panel Survey, ii) they must live in an area projected to be at very high, high, or medium risk of experiencing extreme winter conditions, according to a risk map published by IRIMHE on January 10, 2021, and (iii) they must own livestock. The eligibility of households was assessed based on survey data available in February 2021. At this time, data from panel wave 4 of the Coping with Shocks in Mongolia Household Panel Survey was available for 793 households. For 975 households, for whom panel wave 4 data was unavailable at the time, information from previous panel waves was used. Based on the latest available data, a study sample of 925 households meeting the three eligibility criteria was selected.\n Among these 925 eligible households, 421 were assigned to the treatment group, while 504 were allocated to the control group through a random lottery implemented in STATA by the authors. Treatment households were earmarked to receive an average of 236 USD as a one-off unconditional cash transfer from the NGO People in Need (PIN). \n Randomization was conducted on the sub-district level (using the latest information on the sub-district of residence available in February 2021). The 925 eligible households lived in 111 sub-districts. 50 sub-districts were randomly selected to comprise the treatment group. In February 2021, all eligible households in these districts were surveyed by the National Statistics Office of Mongolia (NSO) and informed that they were chosen to receive a cash transfer. Enumerators were able to locate and survey 381 of the 421 households selected for treatment. All those 381 households gave their consent to participate in the study.\n The 50 sub-districts in the treatment group were assigned to two treatment arms with varying values for the cash transfer. Eligible households in 25 sub-districts in the treatment group were assigned to receive a cash transfer of 177 USD, while eligible households in the other 25 sub-districts in the treatment group were assigned to receive a cash transfer of 295 USD. \n All those 381 households gave their consent to participate in the study. In March 2021, PIN distributed cash transfers via bank transfer to 381 households participating in the pre-intervention survey.\n Kraehnert, K., Lehmann-Uschner, K., Groppo, V., Bertram-Huemmer, V., Fluhrer, S., Mogge, L., Roeckert, J., & Wojewska, A.

Parent-child pairs will be randomly assigned to receive apps or non-digital learning materials. Parents will then be randomly assigned within the two modalities, either to be present or absent for the experiment. Holding the time constant, any difference in skill acquisition between the beginning and end of the experiment will be due to differences in the efficiency of the materials in the two scenarios where the parent is either present or absent.\n Experiment 2 (2 treatment arms):\nIn this experiment, we randomly assign parents to a treatment in which we temporarily increase their cognitive load or to a treatment in which we do not increase cognitive load. There are standard methodologies for temporarily increasing cognitive load, such as asking participants to count backward by 7s from 100 and other similar tasks that tax cognition. As in experiment 1, we test how much children learn from digital or non-digital materials. Because low-income parents are more likely to have a high cognitive load, this can also potentially explain why low-income parents engage less with their children in math activities.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe intent of the field experiments is to test several potential explanations for how digital apps and non-digital materials influence math learning. There are two main experiments. Experiment 1 asks whether digital apps are more efficient at conveying math skills and what role the parent plays in skill development. Experiment 2 asks how parents’ cognitive load affects children’s learning with digital and non-digital materials. \n The experiments have the same general format in that parent-child pairs will come to the experimental site, consent to the experiment, be randomized to a treatment group or a control group, and participate in a 30–45-minute experiment. Children will be given a brief assessment of a specific math skill at the beginning and end of the experiment and the difference in score will be the main outcome for each experimental comparison. Each experiment will also assess children’s enthusiasm for learning, measured by whether when given the chance children choose to spend more time on another math activity. All experiments will be live coded by researchers and video recorded for auditing purposes.\n We will survey parents at baseline and at the end of the intervention to collect data on family demographic characteristics, parents’ reports of the home learning environment, parents’ beliefs and expectations about their children’s math skill development, and parents’ expected return on their time and material investments in children’s math skill development. We will also ask questions that measure parents’ math anxiety and growth mindset and parents’ reports of the structural, behavioral, and cognitive barriers that stand in the way of their child’s math skill development. These will be used as covariates in the analysis of changes in assessment scores. We will manage the equal distribution of low vs. high income into those groups by stratifying on income within the randomization procedure.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe efficiency of digital v. non-digital math learning materials in conveying numeracy skill to preschool-aged children analyzed by parent socio-economic status, Role of parent engagement in conveying math skill with digital v. non-digital math learning materials.

The conceptual framework of the intervention is shown in Figure 1. \nSalt Reduction Training (SRT)\nTo improve participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and low-salt intake while maintaining high self-efficacy, a two-day educational training, Salt Reduction Training (SRT),was conducted weekly. Each 90-minute session with 8–10 participants was followed by a 15 minute break. This training applied learning methods derived from geragogy and self-efficacy concepts. Geragogy is defined as a process involved in stimulating and helping the elderly to study (John,1988). \nIn SRT, the geragogy concept is used with frequent repetition and evaluation of key points in hypertension self-care, including demonstrating how to measure daily salt intake and prioritizing important skills. Self-efficacy concepts were utilized by stressing that maintaining a low-salt diet is easy, changing negative thoughts about salt and hypertension, and reinforcing positive attitudes during discussion. In addition, to motivate participants, trained elderly role models who had implemented low-salt diets shared their experiences about the benefits and ease of implementing a low-salt diet. Participants were given time to ask questions. To master the concepts of a low-salt diet, participants and researchers cooked a low-salt menu together during the second day of training. The majority of training information and leaflets were in pictures, including the leaflets “You Can Deal with High Blood Pressure by Reducing Salt Intake.”\nSalt Reduction and Efficacy Maintenance (SREM) program\nOne month after training, participants in the SREM group attended a 90-minutefollow-up meeting, called a maintenance meeting, designed to help them overcome difficulties and challenges they faced in applying a low-salt diet. Members in the SRT group received only the initial two-day training. Table 1 gives an overview of the intervention given to the SRT and SREM groups. During the maintenance meeting, participants shared their progress, benefits, and challenges of following a low-salt diet. Role models were invited again for interactive discussions with participants. As opposed to the mainly one-way communication by role models during the SRT, in the maintenance meeting, both role models and participants had a lively discussion because they had implemented a low-salt diet together. Any solutions and progress reported in this meeting were reinforced. Participants were given a chance to adjust their low-salt diet targets based on difficulties and solutions offered by other participants.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nA randomized controlled trial (RCT) assigned participants to one of three groups: a control group and two kinds of intervention groups—the Salt Reduction Training (SRT) group and the Salt Reduction and Efficacy Maintenance (SREM) group.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nAt the end of intervention, participants in SREM group had improved their knowledge, attitudes, and low-salt intake while maintaining high self-efficacy,\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Subjects perform a coin-toss task and report their outcomes. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of the four treatments. In the text treatment, subjects are told to report their coin-toss outcomes to a chatbot by answering a questionnaire. In the voicebot treatment, subjects are told to report the outcomes to a voicebot. In the AIbot treatment, subjects are told to report the outcomes to a sophisticated voicebot. In the human treatment, subjects are told to report the outcomes to an experimenter. At the end of the experiment, we also ask questions that measure the subject's attitudes towards AI and chatbot, trust, and demographics.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe run an online experiment via Prolific, an online platform for recruiting online. We design an online voice chat platform for this expeirment. We use Qualtrics and the designed online platform (voice interaction platform) to collect answers. The study consists of three parts. In the first part, participants will be given an instruction on the study. In the second part, participants will toss a coin 7 times, record the results of coin tosses on a paper, and report the results to a human voice or a voicebot. Participants will be told that they will get 30 cents for each head they toss. The link to the voicebot or the human voice will be provided in Qualtrics. During the interaction with the voicebot or the human voice, the participants' voices will be recorded. After this, the participants will be redirected to the Qualtrics and answer questions in the third part. Participants will get an additional $1 for answering questions in this part. The questions include measurements of participants' perceptions of the Chatbot, measurements of their personality, and demographic information.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe number of reported heads\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe acoustic feature of the recorded voice\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Self-reported mask use is secondary, as our earlier research suggest such data may not be reliable due to social desirability bias., To test channels through which interventions increase mask use (H2), we also collect detailed data on respondents' knowledge of different aspects of covid-19 transmission, symptoms and risk factors, as well as their views on the social desirability of masks., For H3, we additionally collect data on how information on covid-19 and mask use spreads within villages and social networks, such as who individuals talked to about these issues, how often and when., For H4, we collect data on social distancing from both self-reports (including the number of in-person interactions, travel patterns, attendance at markets and religious services, etc.) and public observations (including whether an observed individual maintains at least 2m of distance while interacting with others). In addition, we collect detailed data on households' economic activities, including income, self-employment, employment, consumption, food security. Lastly, we collect data on covid-related symptoms, testing and test-outcomes for covid-19 and other health-seeking behaviors and health outcomes., We will further pre-specify these outcomes in a registered pre-analysis plan before conducting any data analysis.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

During each round, subjects worked for two weeks and then received their pay either a) in weekly installments beginning at the end of the second week of work; or b) in a single lump sum, about three weeks after the last day of work.\n In addition to variation in payment frequency, workers received their pay either c) on Fridays or d) on Saturdays. The two variations on the timing of pay -- weekly vs. monthly and Friday vs. Saturday -- were cross-randomized, creating four study arms in each round. The payments were made at the site of a major local market that occurs on Saturdays, with the intention of inducing variation in people's temptation to overspend. During the week after the last payday in each round, all workers were visited for a detailed survey about their expenditure and income.\n The variation in the day of the week of the payment was designed to shed light on the mechanisms behind the savings constraints people face. If money is received in a tempting environment, like the local market day, then arguably costs to resisting that temptation increase and workers would decide to spend and consume more right at the market when receiving their pay.\n We picked Saturdays at the local trading center -- so that payroll for this group happened during the major market in the local area -- as a tempting context for the receipt of income. This choice was based on extensive qualitative and descriptive work with people in the local area. Anecdotally, people in Mulanje District often describe market days as tempting situations, in which excitement can cause them to purchase things they would rather not.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nOur key outcome variables are:, 1.

Evidence from MGNREGA in India\nRCT_ID: AEARCTR-0001292\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.1292-3.3\n\nINTERVENTION_TEXT:\nThis randomized control trial (RCT), which takes place at scale in two large Indian states, investigates how wage payment delays to workers in the government's large workfare program are affected by decreasing costs of acquiring management-relevant information by lower-level bureaucrats and reducing the costs of monitoring by higher-level bureaucrats.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe randomized access to PayDash at the district level to the following treatment arms: \n1.) Control: Both block and district-level officials overseeing the wage payment process must rely on status quo information sources about payment processing. These sources are readily available but time consuming to compile and examine on a regular basis. \n2.) District only PayDash access: Only the highest level of supervisors across the districts receive access to the PayDash platform, ensuring they are better able to monitor payment activity and delays managed by lower-level block officials. \n3.) Block only PayDash access: Only the lower-level managers (block officials) receive access to PayDash. Information in the platform helps these officials identify and process payments in their jurisdiction. \n4.) District + Block PayDash: Both district and block-level MGNREGA officials have individualized access to the platform.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nOur main outcomes of interest are the mean and absolute average deviation in the time to payment for payment sub-steps under the purview of block and district officials, as captured through administrative data used in our system.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nWe also will examine MGNREGA-related outcomes available from the MGNREGA MIS, including work requested, number of person-days worked, and total wage and materials expenditure. Contingent on funding availability, we will conduct endline surveys and qualitative interviews with officials to understand changes in their management practices, time allocation, and professional networks, and to obtain additional platform design feedback useful to scale-up.\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The letters state that the tax authority has developed a new system to monitor VAT compliance and that the VAT returns will be closely monitored. The letters list up to 3 detected discrepancies and ask taxpayers to submit an amendment to correct any existing discrepancies. Finally, the letters point out that a failure to comply can result in additional enforcement measures or prosecution.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe first step of the experimental design selects a \"base sample\" of firm-pairs. The criteria to be included in this base sample are: both firms in the buyer-seller pair must be registered for VAT, must have filed a VAT return in the last month, must not be part of the URA's annual audit plan for the financial year (2017/18), and must have an accumulated discrepancy above 1 million UGX (approximately 270 USD) over the previous 10 months. \n In the second step, we employ an iterative randomization procedure to select firm-pairs to be included in the \"study sample\". Once the first firm-pair is randomly selected, we remove all the trading partners of the two firms (buyer and seller) from the base sample. Then, we randomly select another firm-pair and remove all their trading partners. Following this iterative procedure, we obtain a set of firm-pairs which are (i) separated by at least two nodes in the network of firm-to-firm transactions and (ii) have an accumulated misreporting discrepancy that is greater than 270 USD over the past year.\n In the third step, we apply a stratified randomization procedure to allocate firms from the study sample to three treatment arms and a control group. In the first treatment arm, the letter is sent only to the buyer in the selected pair. In the second treatment arm, the letter is sent to the seller. Finally, in the third arm, letters are sent to both the buyer and seller.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nThe criteria for the first step were determined in collaboration with the Uganda Revenue Authority. Our base sample consists of 15,983 firm-pairs. In the second step, we obtain a study sample of 1,673 firm-pairs. In the third step, we randomly assign 40% of firms (677) to be part of the control group. The remaining 60% (996) are divided up equally across the three treatment arms. In this randomization process, we stratify by the ratio of sales to final consumers, firm size (measured by total revenue from sales), and by whether or not the firms' headquarters are located in or outside Kampala (the capital city of Uganda).\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nRetrospective outcomes: amendment of past returns (binary), amount amended (in million UGX), change in pre-treatment VAT liability after amendment (in million UGX)., Forward-looking outcomes: actual vs. predicted VAT liability in post-treatment returns, probability that the VAT liability is positive, probability that VAT liability in a given month is higher than the VAT liability in the same month the year before, probability of misreporting, amount misreported, probability of underreporting, amount underreported, continuation of the trading relationship, reported transaction volume for the pair (in million UGX).\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

As part of the experiments online subjects are randomized into different treatment groups. In 4 out 5 experiments subjects are randomized in terms of whether they receive their preferred article choice. 3 out 5 experiments work with additional sub-randomization in which different sub-interventions are applied (psychological primes, cognitive load tasks, fact-checking).\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nAll interventions are conducted as part of online surveys with different online panel providers. In total, we conduct five experiments:\n Experiment 1: Priming experiment. We randomly assign psychological primes to all study subjects. Psychological primes relate to forming ten sentences, each sentence contains of five words. There are two treatment groups (T1 and T2). In T1 all subjects receive words and sentences with non-religious content. In T2 subjects receive five sentences with religious and five sentences with non-religious content. \nAfter the priming, study subjects select their preferred information sources for different topics. There are four types of sources (media, government, academic, religious) and four types of topics (2 health topics, 1 environmental topic, 1 religious’ topic). The order in which topics appear and in which the sources are listed is randomized. \n Experiment 2: Information acquisition. Experiment 2 consists of two parts. Both parts involve a two step-process. In the first step, participants can select one out of four article titles that they would like to read. Titles reflect two different sources (Muhammadiyah vs. Nadul Ulama – two religious bodies in Indonesia) and two different opinions (pro and against smoking). In step 2 subjects are randomized into whether they receive an article that contains their preferred title (one out of four title options) or not (three out of four title options). The body of the article (three paragraphs) is identical for each subject and reflects arguments pro and against smoking. This experimental set-up is randomly assigned to 50 percent of all participants and we refer to this as PART A. For the other 50 percent of participants, the procedure is the same as in PART A, but with the exception that we indicate at both stages (article selection and article reading) whether an article was fact-checked for its content or not. At stage 1 about one fourth of the article titles are marked as fact checked; at stage 2 about 50 percent of the articles are marked as fact checked. \n Experiment 3: Cognitive load. We experimentally alter the cognitive load of subjects. Cognitive load tasks relate to the memorization of specific numbers. There are two treatment groups (T1 and T2). In T1 study subjects are asked to memorize a 1-digit number, while in T2 study subjects are asked to memorize a 6-digit number. Following this, study subjects select their preferred article. Subjects can select from four articles titles with titles reflecting 2 opinions (pro or against smoking) and 2 sources (Muhammadiyah vs. Nadul Ulama). In a second step, subjects are randomized to receive their preferred article (one quarter of the title options) vs. a non-preferred article (three-quarter of the title options). \n Experiment 4: Opinion vs. Source. Experiment 4 shall shed light on the role of the information source (religious source) vis-à-vis the informational direction (pro vs. against smoking) for the preference for information and andand information processing. Experiment 4 has three treatment groups (T1, T2, T3). In T1, study subjects see only the titles of articles though no source is displayed. Once subjects select a title, subjects are randomized into receiving their preferred article or not. The article they receive does not display any source. T2 is identical to T1 with the exception that once subjects are assigned an article to read they also see the source of the article. T3 is identical to T2 with the exception that the source of the article is already revealed at the initial stage when subjects are asked to select their preferred article. \n Experiment 5: Article styles and information processing. In experiments 1 to 4 all subjects receive the identical article. Each article contains three paragraphs reflecting different views: One paragraph listing argument against smoking, one paragraph listing arguments why smoking might be permitted under certain circumstances, and one paragraph listing arguments why smoking should be allowed. In experiment 5, the articles displayed are changed such that they only present one position. This means that articles with titles indicating “pro-smoking” only list arguments in favor of smoking arguments, while titles indicating “against-smoking” only list arguments against smoking. Apart from the information (article) displayed, the experimental set-up of experiment 5 is identical to experiment 2 (part A).\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nPreferences/Decisions in terms of (i) article selection and (ii) information processing\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nSecondary outcomes relate to variables that present mechanisms.\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

All third grade students from a given school will take the baseline exam that will identify students that place in the lowest half in each school. The evaluation will target 48 schools in metropolitan Lima that participated in either treatment or control groups in the 2012 pilot project.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nThe evaluation will target low-performing third-grade students from 48 schools in metropolitan Lima that participated in either treatment or control groups in the 2012 pilot project. Within each school, half of the low-performing students will be assigned to the remedial education treatment and half to control conditions. The evaluation design will therefore stratify at the school level. \n According to total enrollment levels collected from school principals at baseline in 2012, we anticipate, on average, 48 third-grade students per school distributed in two third-grade sections per school. Logistical reasons explain why we aim to target the same schools as the 2012 pilot. In the treatment schools, UCH already has contacts with the administration, which should facilitate the implementation of the program. In addition, data collection by IPA in the control schools went according to plan and there was little attrition and non-response.\n IPA Peru will administer a baseline evaluation test to students in April 2014. This test will be a similar though simplified version of the science test that was used in the 2012 Science Education pilot. This test was developed to assess third-grade science proficiency according to the Peruvian National Curriculum, which includes as subdomains: “Physical World” (“Mundo Físico y conservación del ambiente”), “Human body and health” (“Cuerpo humano y conservación de la salud”) and “Animals and environment conservation” (“Animales y ambiente”). It is a timed self-administered written test that students will be given to complete on their own, without a surveyor. A surveyor will be present at the school to supervise the appropriate and timely administration of the test. Each section (corresponding to one of the three areas of the curriculum) is separately timed.\n During the implementation of the program, IPA Peru will develop an end-line test of the same abilities measured for the baseline. The test will be given at the end of the school year to all the third grade students in participating schools to see if those who were placed in the treatment group were able to close the gap with the other students from their class. Both baseline and end-line will be norm-referenced, standardizing all student test scores in standard deviations above or below the control group mean. \n In addition, teachers will be surveyed to collect demographic data and to gather their views on different aspects of teaching Science and Environment. Collecting this information at baseline and end-line will permit observing any changes in teacher’s perceptions of teaching science material. School directors of the sample schools will also be surveyed about their experience and characteristics of their schools, including the number of teachers, school enrollment, infrastructure, equipment and learning materials and school climate. Lastly, students will be sent home with questionnaires for parents with questions about the support and assistance that the child receives for homework, the household's socioeconomic status and other characteristics such as household size and education of parents. Both the data collected at baseline from the school directors and parents will serve to ensure balance between treatment and control groups. Additionally, the data will also be used to perform heterogeneity analysis to identify variation in effects between subgroups, such as students in homes with a working television, or students in schools with operational sanitation facilities\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nKey evaluation outcome measures are: i) students’ understanding of science and the environment and ii) performance on achievement tests.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Our financial literacy tutorial is structured in four parts: (1) questions pertaining to each student's financial situation; (2) questions soliciting baseline financial literacy knowledge; (3) information on the benefits and costs of college and how short-run decisions may impact long-run outcomes; and (4) information about existing financial literacy resources at Penn State. The tutorial takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and is delivered online via Qualtrics We track student responses to each question as well as clicks and time information to track how long students spend on each question and section. In Part (3) that provides instead of elicits information we force students to spend 15 seconds on each page before progressing to encourage them to carefully read all the material.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nOur experiment is based on a randomized encouragement design. We randomize students into one of three groups: a true control, an email offer or an incentive offer. The true control cannot participate in the intervention so we have one-sided non-compliance. Students randomized into an offer either receive an email invitation, or an email invitation with a $10 incentive to complete the tutorial. We conduct the randomization by cohort: first, second, and third year students based on their academic standing. The second year students had one additional treatment arm: an incentive in the form of a campus bookstore gift card which was a requirement from one of the sponsors. We stratified the randomization by underrepresented minority status, first-generation college student status, in-state tuition status, and quartiles of the admissions evaluation criteria.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nCredits earned, grade point average, retention.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

All studies are randomized into one of three arms: two treatments and a control. More details on the experiment can be found in the embargoed experimental design field and the attached PAP.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nThis study will test the effectiveness of two types of nudges, \"salience of missing information\" and a lottery, at prompting collaborators to update the post-trial fields on their registration. The treatments are randomized at the trial entry level, and each individual in the sample will receive one set of emails (initial and, if needed, follow-up) per registration for which they are listed as a \"collaborator\", with the email content varying depending on whether the registration has been assigned to control, treatment 1, or treatment 2. As individuals on multiple trials will receive multiple emails and, most likely, multiple treatments, we will test both spillovers and dosage effects by including terms in our main specification for counts of control, treatment 1, and treatment 2 emails received per trial, as well as the number of collaborators on a trial.\n Randomization is stratified by a categorical variable with three values: 1) “single trial PIs”: trials where no collaborator is listed on any other trial; 2) “multi-trial PIs”: trials where at least one collaborator is on at least one other trial, but no collaborators are on five or more other trials; and 3) “many-trial PIs”: trials where at least one collaborator is on at least five other trials.\n Within the strata the randomization probability is set to weight all three arms evenly so as to produce three arms per stratum with near-equal numbers of trial entries. \n We start with all collaborators on all trials listed on the AEA RCT Registry. We then apply 4 ex-ante sample restrictions. Specifically, the trials must:\n - Be at least one year post the listed trial end date as of the sample extraction date \n- Have some empty post-trial fields, with the set of relevant fields described in the pre-analysis plan\n- Not have any collaborators who meet any of the following “centrality”-related criteria:\n - be listed on >=20 registry entries\n - be a collaborator on trials with >=20 other collaborators\n Collaborators on trials that meet the following criteria will still receive treatment, but we will\nexclude them from the main analysis:\n- Any collaborator on the trial was in the 63-person sample for our associated qualitative survey of registry users\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nFirst-stage outcomes:, Email open rate, Page visit rate, Primary outcome:, Index of research results reported (described in more detail in attached PAP)\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

The intervention was originally developed to prevent parenting problems and child maltreatment and generally improves the living environment of the child. Supportive Parenting is currently offered by 188 out of the 344 municipalities in the Netherlands. Around the 14th day after birth, a nurse who works at a child health clinic (consultatiebureau) visits every family in the Netherlands with a newborn child. During this visit, the nurse explains to all parents in regions that offer Supportive Parenting what the intervention entails and hands out a questionnaire that is used to identify eligible parents. The screening questionnaire tries to identify parents who are at risk of child maltreatment. The items to determine eligibility were carefully selected during the development of the intervention and the choice of variables is explained in detail by Bouwmeester et al. (2006). The questionnaire contains items on the following domains: parents' childhood experiences, parents' perceptions and expectations, parents' mental health, parents' history with substance abuse, parents' relationship with their partner, parents' social support system, parents' age, and the child's health at birth. \n After the screening, nurses contact families that are eligible for the intervention by phone. The nurse again explains the intervention, discusses the outcomes of the screening questionnaire, and schedules the first house visit. Supportive Parenting is a voluntary programme, where additional support is offered to parents who could use some extra help. The nurse explains to parents that children benefit when their parent is doing well, when they are comfortable and confident in their parenting, and when they are aware of the effect their own childhood experiences can have on their behaviour. Supportive Parenting helps parents be the best version of themselves, which will in turn benefit the child. Ideally, Supportive Parenting is offered to all parents, but for financial reasons the intervention is targeted. The nurse explains to parents that the questionnaire they filled out helps nurses to find those parents who would possibly benefit most from Supportive Parenting. The intervention is not a way for municipalities to monitor parental behaviour or to check whether child maltreatment takes place within the household. \n After eligible parents indicate their interest in the intervention, a youth healthcare nurse visits parents when the child is approximately 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months old. This is in addition to care as usual, e.g. the normal visits to the child health clinics. Depending on the family situation, additional visits might be planned, either as house visits or a phone consultation. Visits are generally between 60 and 90 minutes each, depending on parental preferences. For example, some parents prefer to have shorter house visits that occur more often. The nurses who conduct house visits work at a child health clinic (consultatiebureaus) and receive additional training before the start of the intervention. During this training, nurses learn all the practicalities of the intervention, such as the structure of the house visits, the content to be discussed with parents, and the material available. Nurses learn how to explain the intervention to parents and how to discuss the sometimes delicate questionnaire items with them. In Supportive Parenting, nurses focus on the ontogenic system, the microsystem, and the exosystem used by Belsky (1980) and on the concept of parental awareness used by Baartman (1996) to explain child maltreatment. Belsky (1980) argues that there are stress and support factors in the ontogenic system, which regards the individual parent, the microsystem, which includes their immediate family, and the exosystem, which regards the broader social support system. Nurses learn to identify these factors of support and stress. Baartman (1996) explains child abuse by looking at conflicting interests between parents and children. He divides parental awareness into expectations, perceptions, and sensitivity. Nurses help parents to understand their expectations of and perceptions on the development of their child. They also focus on parents' sensitivity, defined as the ability of parents to see, understand, and anticipate what a child needs and to adequately respond to this. The training teaches nurses to identify factors of improvement. For example, for the development of children, healthy bonding with their parent is important. Nurses learn how to recognise attachment styles that are secure, avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganised. They then learn how to respond to the signals they pick up on. The training includes sufficient time for nurses to practice, with an actress playing a mother who is eligible for the intervention. The Supportive Parenting training takes approximately 18 hours.\n During the house visits, nurses guide parents by open questions to indicate what their struggles are and where they would like to see improvement. The lengthy house visits give nurses far more time, compared to the regular child health clinic visits, to listen to parents and truly understand where nurses can support them best. The main topics of discussion include the development of the child, the expectations and experiences of the parents, and the social life and support system of the parents. For the development of the child, the nurse and parents focus on the health of the child, their sleeping pattern, and the relation between the child and the parents. For the expectations and experiences of parents, parents get the opportunity to talk about their own childhood. The nurse listens to their stories and helps them reflect on their experiences. This helps parents to understand where certain behaviours come from and whether their expectations are realistic. The nurse and parents use this to improve unhealthy parenting behaviours. For the social life and support system of parents, the nurse helps parents in combining parenthood with having a job, having a social life, and having a partner. It is important for parents to have a balance in their lives and it can be difficult for (new) parents to combine all these obligations. Here, the nurse and parents focus on building a network for practical and social support. The nurse helps parents to realise who they can turn to for support. This support can come from within the parents' network, from new social contacts, or from professional help. If needed, the nurse guides parents into finding further professional support, such as psychological help.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe use data from the RCT conducted in 2002. Parents are randomly divided into treatment and control groups. At the start of the intervention, all parents fill out the following questionnaires:\n- Kort Instrument voor de Psychologische en Pedagogische Probleeminventarisatie (KIPPPI): an instrument to identify problematic socio-emotional development of children.\n- Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI): an instrument to estimate the risk of maltreatment.\n- Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI): an instrument developed to look at parental behaviour on the domains of inappropriate parental expectations, parental lack of an empathetic awareness of children’s needs, strong belief in the use and value of corporal punishment, parent-child role reversal, and oppressing children’s power and independence.\n- Social Support questionnaire: an instrument to map parents' support system.\n Those in the control group receive care as usual, e.g. standard visits to child health clinics. Parents in the treatment group receive six house visits of 90 minutes each, when the child is 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 18 months old. During each visit, the nurse who conducts the house visits, reports on the general development of the child, the bond between the parent(s) and child, the problems the parent(s) experience(s) in raising the child, and the social support system of the parent(s). \n When the child is 12 months old, parents in both groups again fill out questionnaires (KIPPPI, CAPI, AAPI, Social Support). In addition, when the child is 12 months old, a doctor at the child health clinic (consultatiebureau) and a general practitioner report on the development of the child. At the end of the intervention, parents again fill out questionnaires (KIPPPI, CAPI, AAPI, Social Support). Parents also fill out a reflection questionnaire about their experience with Supportive Parenting and the nurse who conducts the house visits fills out a final report. When the child is 24 months old, a doctor at the child health clinic and a general practitioner report on the development of the child. \n For a subgroup of our sample, we have follow-up data. When these children are 5 years old, their parents receive questionnaires from the school nurse. These include the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI), and the Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index (Nosi-R). The SDQ is an instrument to diagnose psycho-social problems in children. The Nosi-R is an instrument to estimate the stress parents experience. The SDQ is handed out to all children, whereas the other questionnaires are only handed out to those who are part of the intervention or treatment group.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nParents' view on parenthood., Educational outcomes of children., Mental health of children.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe use of other interventions and professional help by parents and children. This includes, among other things,, social work, preschool, parenting aid, and psychological help., Mental health of parents., Social support of parents., Parental views and experience of stress when the child is 5., Physical health of children., Physical health of parents., Financial situation of parents, including parents’ education, income, and job., Later born children, including the timing of having additional children and the number of siblings.

In developing the manual, CBT strategies were blended with after-session Yoga exercises. The CBT sessions were based on using the “ABCDE” model (Antecedent/Activating event, Beliefs, Consequences, Disputing, and Effective new philosophy) to identify, assess, revalidate and change unhelpful absolutistic and irrational beliefs associated with work experiences. The major aims of Y-CBT were to 1) use ABCDE group therapeutic model (CBT) in “disputing” – challenging and questioning teachers’ work-related irrational and dysfunctional beliefs and to replace them with rather helpful and functional beliefs [84] 2); use yoga to reduce the physiological symptoms of stress and helping the participants oust of the vicious circle of negative thoughts through Yoga “Victory Meditation,” affirmations and physical exercises.[55] This framework helped provide a targeted mind/body approach to stress perceptions, reactions, and symptoms.\nThe ABCDE formed the basis of explaining the relationships links between activating\n (A) events associated with teaching children with ASD, dysfunctional thoughts, beliefs or cognitions arising from those events (B); the emotional and behavioral consequences of the beliefs (C) [84] Then, disputation techniques (D) are used to eliminate the maladaptive, dysfunctional, and self-limiting beliefs and cognitions. [84, 85, 86] Disputation involves challenging and comparing the maladaptive thoughts with more adaptive ones. Ellis [87] theorized that the best way to counter irrational beliefs is by considering realistic and logical ones. Hence as participants become aware of and counteract their dysfunctional beliefs, they come up with more effective world-views (E). This ABCDE model as used in earlier studies formed the basis of activities throughout the intervention (See table 1).\nYoga complementary approaches involved after-session physical/posture exercise and meditation practices. The interaction between cognitions, emotions, and physical symptoms were highlighted and skills were taught to reduce the incongruity between sensation and perception. Traditional Yoga (asanas, breathing exercises, and meditation) exercises were used in maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The traditional Yoga used in this study was appropriate for beginners, given that it is mild and does not demand too much effort. The Yoga intervention was meant to help participants understand and appreciate the interplay between their bodily sensations and emotional feelings. Ten different asanas posses were used, which are Tadasana (Mountain pose); Vrikshasana (Tree Pose); Adho Mukho Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog Pose); Trikonasana (Triangle Pose); Kursiasana(Chair Pose); Naukasana (Boat Pose); Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose); Paschimottanasana; Child's Pose and Sukhasna. [88]\nBreathing exercises focused on basic Breath Awareness; Ujjayi Pranayama (Victorious Breath or Ocean Breath); Kapalabhati Pranayama (Breath of Fire or Skull-Shining Breath); Kumbhaka Pranayama (Breath Retention), Nadi Shodhana Pranayama (Alternate-Nostril Breathing). Meditation involved getting quiet, calm, and focused; mind slows down, relaxation, and staying positive by focusing on something that brings you peace to mind as well as choosing to shed go all the negative thoughts that interfere with health. Meditation also helps you become more mindful of your mind and body.\nHence, in Y-CBT we designed a 12 weeks module of CBT accompanied by traditional yoga exercises as discussed above. Each session of the module includes information, exercises, worksheets, images, examples, homework exercises, and template for progress feedback.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe current study adopted a group-randomized waitlist control trial design with pretest, post-test, and follow-up assessments. Participants included 75 teachers of children with autism in public and private special schools in Lagos state. Participants were randomly assigned to Y-CBT (N=33) and waitlist control (WLC) (N=32) groups.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nThe current study adopted a group-randomized waitlist control trial design with pretest, post-test, and follow-up assessments.

The emphasis of the paper is how the impact of the different effort motivators varies when the design of the experiment is changed with different versions.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nSubjects will choose to participate in this study by selecting it on Amazon's Mechanical Turk service. Before the participants choose to participate, they will be provided with a brief description of the study (a” typing task”) which also tells a guaranteed flat-pay for successful submission ($1) and a time estimate for completion. Once in the task, participants are assigned to one of four versions, and within each version they are directed to complete a task with randomly-selected incentive structures. \n Version 1 is a direct replication of the task used by DellaVigna and Pope (REStud 2018): participants press two alternating keyboard buttons ('a' and 'b') within a given time period (10 minutes). There are 16 different randomly-assigned treatments with varying levels and types of incentives. For example, some participants will be given bonus payments based on points scored, others will raise money for charity, and some will receive no bonus. All participants are clearly informed of their incentive structure and bonus opportunities before playing their task. There is no deception at any point in this task.\n Version 2 is similar to Version 1 except that the task consists of coding the occupation from World War II historical cards for 10 minutes. As in version 1, the participants are randomized in one of 16 treatments with varying levels and types of incentives.\n Version 3 involves coding of WWII cards, as in Version 2. However, this time all subjects are required to code 40 cards as their main task. After the coding of the 40 cards is completed, subjects are randomized into 16 different treatments, parallel to the ones used in Version 1 and 2. The treatments consist of different incentives offered to the participants in case they agree to code additional WWII cards, up to 20 extra cards. \n Version 4 is the same as version 3, except that, unlike in Versions 1-3, there is no consent form prior to participating in the tasks, so subjects do not know that the task is an experiment. (Notice that the participants are coding historical data as part of an economic history project, so this is a data coding assignment.)\n Upon completion of the task, participants will be thanked for their contribution and the flat payment of $1, along with any additional money won, will be paid within the designated time period for their treatment (typically within 24 hours). \n The final sample will exclude subjects that:\n(1) do not complete the MTurk task within 30 minutes of starting;\n(2) exit and then re-enter the task as a new subject (as these individuals might see multiple treatments);\n(3) are not approved for any other reason (e.g. they did not having a valid MTurk ID);\n(4) In version 1 (a-b typing) do not complete a single effort unit; there is no need for a parallel requirement for version 2 since the participants have to code a first card to start the task;\n(5) in version 1 scored 4000 or more a-b points (since this would indicate cheating);\n(6) in version 2 coded 120 or more cards with accuracy below 50% (since this would indicate cheating);\n(7) in versions 3 and 4 completed the 40 required cards in less than 3 minutes with accuracy below 50%, or completed the 20 additional cards in less than 1.5 minutes with accuracy below 50% (since this would indicate cheating).\n Restrictions (1)–(5) are exactly the same as in the DellaVigna-Pope (REStud) experiment; restrictions (6)-(7) are meant to parallel restriction (5) for the new task. We expect that restrictions (3)-(7) are likely to be binding in only a small number of cases. For example, in a pilot of 400 subjects we did not have anyone in categories (3)-(7).\n The average score in each of these treatments and versions will form the basis for the elicitation of expert forecasts.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe key outcome variable is a measure of average effort. The measure of effort differs across the four different versions of the experiment. In versions 1 it is the number of points scored by the subject in 10 minutes, where each point is scored as a result of pressing ‘a’ then ‘b’. In versions 2 it is the number of WWII cards coded by the subject in 10 minutes. In versions 3 and 4 it is the number of extra WWII cards coded by the participants beyond the required 40 cards. Within each version and within each of the 16 treatments that we run in each version, we compute the average of the measure of effort across the subjects in that version-treatment cell.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

We will also randomize half of the control participants and non-story treatment participants to additional timed questions of the same total duration as the story. \n We will collect outcomes both during the main experimental survey and during an obfuscated follow-up survey.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nWe have three primary outcomes:, 1) Contacting legislators: We will ask participants to first write out a personalized letter to their representatives in Congress advocating for ambitious climate action. Then, we will give participants a link to a form to send the letter through the National Resource Defense Council. Participants must remain anonymous, so we cannot observe whether participants actually send the letter. We can observe whether they write a letter and whether they click the link to send it., 2) Donations to a climate organization: We will tell participants that one respondent will be chosen to win an $80 bonus, and they can donate any amount of that to the Natural Resource Defense Council, the Sunrise Movement, or the Citizens' Climate Lobby. We will observe whether and how much people donate., 3) Collective-efficacy beliefs: We will elicit participants' agreement with a series of qualitative statements reflecting how government responds to citizen advocacy on issues like climate change.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nWorry about climate change, Desire for Congress to prioritize climate policy, Emotional state, Probabilistic belief that the US successfully meets its Paris Agreement goals, Probabilistic belief that globally we limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, Probabilistic belief about passing future climate policy, Second-order beliefs about support for climate policy in the US, Contents of letters written to Congress, Climate donations in an obfuscated follow-up, Clicking for information on midterm candidates' climate positions in obfuscated follow-up, Probability of voting in the midterm elections or whether already voted, collected in follow-up, Clicking for information on advocacy groups in the main survey and follow-up survey, Clicking on a link to a map of Fridays for Future climate marches\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

In the treated natural villages, parenting trainers, selected by the NHC, will provide parenting training on nutrition and stimulating activities via fortnightly home visits and monthly group activities. During each home visit, parenting trainers will first spend 30 minutes teaching the primary caregiver how to stimulate each child’s development through fun and interactive play activities (using a set staged-based curriculum), and then spend 10 minutes measuring child’s anthropometrics (height and weight) and providing nutrition guidance. For the group activities, parenting trainers will invite all assigned caregiver-baby dyads to join, and then hold a group reading/play/story session. The intervention will be provided for exactly one year from May 2019 to May 2020. One parenting trainer will be assigned 5 to 15 children depending on the travel distance and his/her existing work load.\nWe plan to invite all children aged 6 to 24 months residing in the treatment village to join the programme.

For both treatments Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) developed a brief training component for the teachers, and also coordinated the transfer of money from a savings box held at the school to a local bank for safekeeping. One year into the implementation, we implemented one sub-treatment, a parental involvement workshop, in half of the treatment schools. We measured school inputs, test scores, and attendance, both before and after the intervention.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe selected 136 primary schools from the Jinja, Iganga, Mayuge and Luuka districts of the Busoga Region because they predominantly comprised poor rural and peri-urban schools. We then administered a baseline survey and test during the final trimester of 2009. We then randomly assigned schools to receive either the cash treatment, voucher treatment, or no treatment. Each treatment group comprised 39 schools, and the remaining 58 schools became the control group.\n Following the first randomization, school outreach began. It took two trimesters to recruit the majority of schools, but by the beginning of the third trimester of 2010, 95 percent of the treatment schools had agreed to participate.\n In 2011, we conducted a second randomization for the parent sensitization program, to isolate the effect of the program while still treating all of the schools. Half of the treatment schools were assigned to receive the treatment in the first term of 2011 while the rest received the treatment during the second term. \n Finally, we conducted the follow-up survey and exam during the beginning of the third trimester of 2011.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nSavings levels (by school and by student), familiarity with the program, use of the program, possession of school supplies, parental involvement, savings attitudes, payment of school fees, test scores\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in Rural India\nRCT_ID: AEARCTR-0002048\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.2048-1.0\n\nINTERVENTION_TEXT:\nIn conjunction with a partner microfinance institution, the researchers conducted an RCT to evaluate the impact of offering loan products with flexible repayment schedules. The sample is 3,648 existing clients of the partner MFI, organized into 202 joint-liability borrowing groups of 15-20 members prior to the experiment. The borrowing groups were randomly assigned to receive an offer of one of four types of loans. The small fixed-schedule loan was the standard loan offered to borrowing groups prior to the intervention. Borrowing groups were offered a Rs. 4000 loan amount, repaid on a fixed schedule at monthly meetings. A large fixed-schedule loan offered borrowing groups a Rs. 6000 loan, also repaid on a fixed schedule at monthly meetings. Next, the coupon flexible loan offered borrowing groups Rs. 6000, but allowed principal repayment on a flexible schedule. After making the first three regular monthly payments, borrowers were allowed to lag behind by up to two principal payments. However, the borrowers still had to attend monthly repayment meetings to make an interest payment. Borrowers’ standing was tracked in a coupon booklet with a lending officer’s help. The last loan type, the dairy-focused loan, offered a loan of Rs. 6000, required borrowers to make double principal payments for the first six months, then allowed borrowers to skip principal payments for any consecutive six months after that while still making interest payments at monthly repayment meetings.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe analysis was conducted using the intent-to-treat approach. Immediately after disbursement, the researchers began the first of seven rounds of household surveys, collected at three to five month intervals. The final survey was collected after the end of the loan cycle. Data collected included information on household demographics and conditions, income details, assets and expenditure details, indebtedness, savings and insurance details, as well as detailed information on cattle owned. Researchers used the single difference estimation strategy when comparing results from a single time period, and used the information from all survey rounds in a pooled OLS to compare results over the total loan cycle.\n The analysis finds suggestive evidence of increased income for borrowers using the dairy-specific loan. The main channel seems to be investment in a higher grade of dairy cattle. However, the increase in income did not translate to higher household consumption. There is also some evidence that both flexible repayment schedule loans led to better ability to deal with negative shocks. For lending institutions, both the incidence and level of default increased. However, circumstances in the microfinance industry in India at this time may indicate that these results are not generalizable.\n Take-up compliance was roughly 76%, with 18% of borrowers taking up no loan, and 6% noncompliance. There was no differential attrition across treatments. However, the response rate was significantly lower those that did not accept a loan.

We group the product listings into 4,640 distinct variety groups. We focus on the ``popular'' varieties with greater than 100 orders, aggregated across all stores, and sold by at least two ``small'' stores with fewer than 5 cumulative orders. This screening procedure enables us to create a treatment and control group of ``identical'' product listings. In total, 133 varieties satisfy the above criteria, containing 1,265 product listings from 638 stores.\n Of the 1,265 product listings, 790 are small listings with fewer than 5 orders. We randomize the 790 small listings into three groups of different order and review treatments: a control group C without any order and review treatment, T1 which receives 1 order randomly generated by the research team and a star rating, and T2, which, in addition to receiving an order and a star rating, further receives a detailed review on product and shipping quality.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nfirms' online sales (orders)\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

YMCA members of two large YMCA facilities from YOTA were invited via email to sign up to this program by completing a survey. They were informed that for every day that they attended the YMCA during the program month, an anonymous donor would make a $2 donation to their YMCA branch. The survey also informed participants that they could become part of a second program—the “social recognition program” (SRP). Anyone enrolled in SRP would receive an email at the end of Grow & Thrive revealing the attendance, and thus money generated, of every participant of SRP.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nThe online experiment consisted of three parts. Part one of the experiment began by explaining the nature of the incentives during the program. Participants were told that an anonymous benefactor with an interest in promoting healthy living and supporting the broader community provided funds to incentivize YOTA members to attend their local YMCA more frequently. During the month of the Grow & Thrive program, a $2 donation was made on participants' behalf for each day a participant visited the YMCA, up to a total donation of $60 per person (e.g., 30 visits).\n In part two, participants were told that they might also be randomly selected to participate in SRP. We explained that if a participant was selected into this additional program, he/she would receive an email at the end of Grow & Thrive, which would: (1) list the names of everyone in SRP; (2) list their attendance during Grow & Thrive; and (3) list the total donations generated by them during Grow & Thrive. We explained that only participants in SRP would receive and be listed in the email.\n We then elicited people's willingness to pay for receiving (or avoiding) social recognition (e.g., being part or not of the recognition program) using a combination of the strategy method and the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak elicitation method (BDM). The strategy-proof method contained 11 questions asking participants to state whether at the end of the program they wanted to participate in the social recognition program for different numbers of realized attendances during Grow & Thrive, and then eliciting for each question how much they were willing to pay (between $0 and $8) to guarantee that their choice was implemented (the BDM component). The categories of possible visits were the following: 0 visits, 1 visits, 2 visits, 3 visits, 4 visits, 5 or 6 visits, 7 or 8 visits, 9 to 12 visits, 13 to 17 visits, 18 to 22 visits, and 23 or more visits.\n Each of the eleven questions had the following structure: “If I go X times to the YMCA during Grow & Thrive I would prefer to participate (NOT participate) in the personal recognition program\". Participants were then asked to state, for each of the 11 levels of possible attendance, how much of the experimental budget of $8 they would be willing to give up to guarantee that their decision about social recognition was implemented. The wording was “You said you would rather be part (NOT be part) of the personal recognition program if you go X times to the YMCA. How much of the $8 reward would you give up to guarantee that you will indeed be part (NOT be part) of the personal recognition program?\" Although the procedure was involved, we told participants that, first and foremost, it was in their best interest to answer truthfully. The details were then explained in simple and plain language.\n To preserve random assignment, as well as to minimize any negative inferences that could be drawn about those not in the social recognition group, we guaranteed that the BDM responses would be used to determine assignment only with 10% chance. We explained to participants that they would have a 10% chance of receiving an additional $8 reward in the form of an Amazon gift card, the contents of which would be used to “pay” to implement their choices. If they were selected to be in that 10%, at the end of the experiment a computer would check how many times they actually attended the YMCA. The computer would then randomly choose a number between $0 and $8. If the computer chose a value smaller or equal to the amount they would give up to receive (or avoid) social recognition for the level of their actual attendance during the experiment, then their favorite decision about the SRP would be implemented. In this case, their extra reward would either be equal to $8 with 50% chance, or equal to $8 minus the amount chosen by the computer with 50% chance. If instead the computer chose a value larger than the amount that they would give up to receive/avoid social recognition, then their favorite decision would be implemented with only 50% probability and they would receive a reward of $8. Participants were also told that each draw for each participant is independent.\n From subjects' perspective, this procedure is equivalent to a second price sealed-bid auction against an unknown bidder. Note that providing a 50-50 chance to receive the desired option whenever random draws are above participants' bids was necessary, as otherwise participants would have had an incentive to misrepresent their true preferences in the first part of the “yes/no” elicitation and then simply bid zero.\n Because others' behavior plays a crucial role in social recognition payoffs it was important to ensure that participants had accurate beliefs about others' behavior. Prior to making their decisions about being part of the SRP, participants were therefore informed about the average attendance to their local YMCA during the prior month.\n Part three elicited participants' beliefs about their future attendance during Grow & Thrive. We asked how many times they believed they would attend during the month of the experiment if: (1) they happened to be randomly selected to participate in the social recognition program; (2) they happened not to be selected to SRP; (3) if they happened not to be part of Grow & Thrive (and consequently of SRP). Finally, we reminded participants that a computer would randomly determine whether they would be part of SRP, and we asked them to explicitly agree to participate in Grow & Thrive.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nAttendance and willingness to pay to be in the social recognition program conditional on a realized attendance level.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Some participants are given information that supporters of different political parties perform equally well on factual knowledge questions, while others receive no such information. Afterwards, all participants answer a set of judgment tasks about facts and conspiracy theories, sometimes accompanied by signals about what partisan or educational groups believe. This setup allows us to test whether correcting perceptions about partisan knowledge influences people’s beliefs, information processing, and feelings toward political groups.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe conduct a randomized online survey experiment in South Korea and the United States. Participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. The treatment group receives information that supporters of different political parties perform equally well on factual knowledge questions, while the control group receives no information. After this, participants complete judgment tasks on factual and conspiracy statements, sometimes paired with signals about the majority views of partisan or education groups. This design allows us to test whether correcting perceptions of partisan knowledge influences beliefs, information processing, and affective polarization.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN_DETAILS:\nThe experiment begins with baseline questions on demographics, political attitudes, and affective polarization, followed by two pre-treatment factual judgment tasks. Respondents are then randomly split: the treatment group is informed that partisan groups differ by less than 5% in accuracy on the factual questions, while the control group receives no information.\n Post-treatment, all respondents complete five additional judgment tasks (three factual, two conspiracy), where each task randomly assigns them either an in-party or out-party signal regarding majority opinions. They also complete two additional tasks with education signals (college vs. non-college). In each task, respondents provide a true/false judgment, confidence rating, and estimates of partisan accuracy.\n These tasks enable estimation of (i) treatment effects on out-group disbelief, (ii) in-group bias in information processing, and (iii) changes in affective polarization. Supplementary analyses assess the processing of conspiracy theories, compare partisan versus education signals, account for experimenter demand effects, and test heterogeneity by demographics and partisanship.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nDisbeliefs – Difference between estimated accuracy rates of in-group versus out-group supporters when judging factual statements., In-group bias in information processing – The Extent to which respondents update their judgments more when signals come from in-party members versus out-party members., Affective polarization – Difference in favorable versus unfavorable feelings toward in-party and out-party supporters, measured using feeling thermometers and comfort measures for social relations.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nDisbeliefs about conspiracy theories – Changes in perceived knowledge gaps across partisan groups when evaluating conspiracy theory statements., In-group bias in processing conspiracy theory signals – Extent to which respondents weigh in-party versus out-party cues when exposed to partisan signals on conspiracy theories., Bias in information processing with education signals – Relative responsiveness to signals from college-educated versus non-college-educated groups., Experimenter demand effect – Sensitivity of responses to cues about the experimenter’s hypothesis (measured via repeated risk attitude questions)., Heterogeneity of treatment effects – Variation in treatment impact by demographics (age, gender, partisan groups, etc.).\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

In August 2001, a major microfinance lender began to install hardware permitting branches to communicate information with the bureau, but did not inform borrowers of the use of the bureau. A randomized training campaign was conducted in which 5000 borrowers were informed of the use of the system, how the bureau worked, and the opportunities and risks it presented for them. Institutional data from the lender and bureau was then used to track how a variety of lending outcomes emerged from this structure in which asymmetric information was reduced on the two sides of the market at two different points in time. It was thus possible to disentangle the supply- and demand-side impacts of credit market information, and identify separately the roles of adverse selection, moral hazard, and incentives on group composition.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nImpact of the credit bureau on screening borrowers in and out:, Fraction leaving, Fraction entering, Loan performance of checked and ejected borrowers:, Internal performance prior to Crediref, External performance on loans seen in bureau, Impact of screening on individual client composition., Impact on borrower characteristics, Impact of screening on the extensive margin: performance of new clients:, Performance of first loan:, (Late fees > 1% of principal / Loan more than 2 months delinquent / Average loan size per borrower (US$)), Future behavior:, (Probability of taking subsequent loan / Months until subsequent loan taken / Growth of subsequent loan per borrower), Impact of screening on the intensive margin: performance of ongoing borrowers:, Late fees > 1% of principal, Loan more than 2 months delinquent, Average loan size per borrower (US$), Aggregate effect of use of the bureau for screening on credit agent performance:, New clients per month, Loans per months, Loan performance, Impact of information on performance:, Solidarity Group loans, (Delinquent payment / Amount of late fees (US$) / Late fees > 1% of principal / Loan more than 2 months delinquent), Communal Bank loans, (Delinquent payment / Amount of late fees (US$) / Late fees > 1% of principal / Loan more than 2 months delinquent)\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

Many people confuse the seasonal influenza with a simple cold. However, the “real” influenza in contrast to the simple cold, can lead to severe complications, such as heart muscle and lung infections. The people who are the most vulnerable to contracting the seasonal influenza and whose health can negatively affect the severity of the infection, are in many cases not healthy enough to get vaccinated. Therefore, they rely on herd immunity.\n Vaccinating is the single most effective way to protect people that rely on herd immunity. It is key to have the seasonal influenza vaccination rate as high as possible due to the limited effectiveness of the vaccination. Therefore, it is essential that as many people as possible get vaccinated. According to a study conducted by Spanish scientists, a rate of approximately 85% is needed to protect the ones who rely on herd immunity.\n The overall population of the Kanton Zurich has an influenza vaccination rate of approximately 16% which is equal to the vaccination rate of the employees at the University of Zurich. This is surprising, since the employees, in contrast to most of the rest of the population, can get vaccinated for free.” \n [COVID-19] “Discussing the potential connection between influenza vaccination and the covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic, Dr. Albert Ko, a professor and department chair at the Yale School of Public Health, said the following:\n “I do think immunizing people against influenza has a very important indirect effect,\"\n(https://www.livescience.com/getting-flu-shot-help-coronavirus-outbreak.html)\n He further explains that reducing the amount of influenza infections can “relieve pressure” from hospitals also treating patients with covid-19.”\n\nEXPERIMENTAL_DESIGN:\nWe run a 3-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) providing either no information, or information about the importance of vaccines to reach herd immunity, or the possible importance of influenza vaccination to protect against COVID-19. \nThe RCT is embedded in an online survey sent to all of the employees of the University of Zurich, collecting demographic data, self-reported economic preferences, and beliefs about vaccinations and the medical sector. Completing the online survey is voluntary.\n\nPRIMARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nThe primary outcome of interest is regret for not having undergone vaccination during the previous flu season., Specifically, the question is \"Did you get vaccinated for the influenza season 19/20?\" and the possible answers are \"Yes\"; \"No, but I wish would have\"; \"No, and I do not wish would have\"., We will construct a dummy equal to one if answering \"No, but I wish would have\" and zero otherwise.\n\nSECONDARY_OUTCOMES_RAW:\nWe will further test whether priming leads to an increased willingness to potentially vaccinate against COVID-19,, and if it also changes the reasoning behind vaccination decision, when considering to protect others., Also, if priming influences expected influenza complications and presumed effectiveness of influenza vaccination.\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "design_extraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"design_type": {"type": "string", "enum": ["simple_multiarm", "factorial", "encouragement", "cluster_rct", "crossover", "stepped_wedge", "multistage", "saturation", "discontinuity", "observational", "other"]}, "unit_of_randomization_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_clustered": {"type": "boolean"}, "analysis_unit_canonical": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_outcomes_dedup": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "arms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"arm_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string", "enum": ["control", "treatment", "experimental", "active_comparator", "placebo", "unknown"]}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["arm_id", "name", "role", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "factors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"factor_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "levels": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"level_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": "string"}, "evidence_quote_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["level_id", "name", "description", "evidence_quote_ids"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["factor_id", "name", "levels"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "assignment_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "design_completeness": {"type": "string", "enum": ["complete", "partial", "unclear"]}, "extraction_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}}, "evidence_quotes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "source_doc": {"type": "string", "enum": ["registry", "paper"]}, "quote": {"type": "string"}, "supports": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "source_doc", "quote", "supports"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["design_type", "unit_of_randomization_canonical", "is_clustered", "analysis_unit_canonical", "primary_outcomes_dedup", "arms", "factors", "assignment_rules", "design_completeness", "extraction_sources", "evidence_quotes", "notes"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}
