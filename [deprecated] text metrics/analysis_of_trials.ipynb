Goiás. Randomization is stratified by gender, grade and phone ownership. 57 schools have been assigned to the treatment group, while 30 have been assigned to control. Students in the treatment group will receive nudges (reminders and encouragement messages), sent twice a week, directly on their mobile phones via text messages (SMS). In case the student does not own a phone, messages will be sent to the mobile phone of his/her primary caregiver. The treatment group consists of 12,056 students, while the control group consists of 6,200 students. Within the sample of 12,056 students assigned to receive nudges, less than half (5,188) own their own mobile phone and will receive messages directly. It is also important to note that not all students in the sample have access to the internet and that those who do not can pick up the printed class material once every week and hand in assignments the following week. For the purpose of this study however, we will be able to measure their outcomes in different ways. In addition, students among the treatment group have been further randomised, in groups of 1,507 students, to receive one of eight variations in message content. \\r\\nAt the end of July, we will be able estimate treatment effects on access to the online platform, and assignment completion, from administrative data provided by the Secretariat. Concretely, we have requested weekly student-level data on log in activity – or face-to-face pick-up of class materials – as well as assignment completion (again, online or offline). For those with online access, we hope to get access to daily data, which would allow us to also estimate high-frequency treatment effects through event studies. Last, after face-to-face classes resume, we will have access to administrative records on student-level attendance, grades, grade repetition and enrollment status.      1\n","We set up a field experiment which randomly assigned women to teams which were traditionally all male in the Norwegian military,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n","Classical preference reversal experiment conducted online where subjects choose and evaluate lottery pairs.

Randomization is stratified by gender, grade and phone ownership. 57 schools have been assigned to the treatment group, while 30 have been assigned to control. Students in the treatment group will receive nudges (reminders and encouragement messages), sent twice a week, directly on their mobile phones via text messages (SMS). In case the student does not own a phone, messages will be sent to the mobile phone of his/her primary caregiver. The treatment group consists of 12,056 students, while the control group consists of 6,200 students. Within the sample of 12,056 students assigned to receive nudges, less than half (5,188) own their own mobile phone and will receive messages directly. It is also important to note that not all students in the sample have access to the internet and that those who do not can pick up the printed class material once every week and hand in assignments the following week. For the purpose of this study however, we will be able to measure their outcomes in different ways. In addition, students among the treatment group have been further randomised, in groups of 1,507 students, to receive one of eight variations in message content. \\r\\nAt the end of July, we will be able estimate treatment effects on access to the online platform, and assignment completion, from administrative data provided by the Secretariat. Concretely, we have requested weekly student-level data on log in activity – or face-to-face pick-up of class materials – as well as assignment completion (again, online or offline). For those with online access, we hope to get access to daily data, which would allow us to also estimate high-frequency treatment effects through event studies. Last, after face-to-face classes resume, we will have access to administrative records on student-level attendance, grades, grade repetition and enrollment status.      1\n","We set up a field experiment which randomly assigned women to teams which were traditionally all male in the Norwegian military,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n","Classical preference reversal experiment conducted online where subjects choose and evaluate lottery pairs.

Data Overview (from `df_trials.info()`):**\n","- The dataset contains **11,124 entries** and **50 columns**.\n","- All columns were initially of `object` dtype, necessitating type conversion for appropriate analysis.\n","\n","**2. Missing Values Analysis:**\n","Many columns exhibit a significant percentage of missing values. The top columns with the highest percentage of missing data (e.g., `Post trial documents csv`, `Program files url`, `Public data url`, `Partners`, `Secondary IDs`) show >90% missingness. This suggests these fields are largely optional or sparsely collected.\n","\n","Conversely, core columns like `Title`, `Url`, `Last update date`, `Published at`, `First registered on`, `RCT_ID`, `DOI Number`, `Primary Investigator`, `Status`, `Start date`, `End date`, `Keywords`, and `Intervention start date`, `Intervention end date` are completely populated with no missing values, indicating high data integrity for these critical fields.\n","\n","**3. Data Type Consistency and Conversion:**\n","\n","**a. Date Column Conversions:**\n","- Successfully converted to datetime: `Last update date`, `Published at`, `First registered on`, `Start date`, `End date`, `Intervention start date`, `Intervention end date`.\n","- Columns with conversion failures:\n","    - `Intervention completion date`: 9550 values failed to convert.\n","    - `Data collection completion date`: 9643 values failed to convert.\n","    These failures suggest inconsistencies in date formatting or the presence of non-date strings in these columns.\n","\n","**b. Numeric Column Extractions/Conversions:**\n","Numeric values were successfully extracted and converted for columns such as `Sample size number clusters`, `Sample size number observations`, `Sample size number arms`, `Minimum effect size`, `Number of clusters`, and `Total number of observations`.\n","\n","Descriptive statistics for these columns (after extraction):\n","- **Sample size number clusters_numeric:** count=8684, mean=975.31, std=22068.15, min=0, max=2,000,000\n","- **Sample size number observations_numeric:** count=10856, mean=1773.18, std=24012.14, min=0, max=2,000,000\n","- **Sample size number arms_numeric:** count=10403, mean=537.96, std=5839.09, min=0, max=500,000\n","- **Minimum effect size_numeric:** count=3612, mean=434.03, std=5728.96, min=0, max=333,471\n","- **Number of clusters_numeric:** count=1153, mean=821.11, std=4324.26, min=0, max=122,873\n","- **Total number of observations_numeric:** count=1314, mean=1621.25, std=10070.63, min=0, max=303,396\n","\n","All non-numeric entries or values that could not be extracted were coerced to `NaN`, indicating the presence of descriptive text alongside numbers in the original columns (e.g., \"96 clusters\", \"6494 women\").\n","\n","**c. Boolean Column Consistency:**\n","- `Attrition correlated`, `Public data`, and `Program files` columns showed consistent boolean values (`True`, `False`, or `NaN`), indicating standard representation.\n","\n","**d. Categorical Column Observations:**\n","- **`Status`:** This column shows clear, distinct categories (`in_development`, `completed`, `on_going`, `withdrawn`, `abandoned`) with reasonable counts, suggesting good data quality and consistency.\n","- **`Experimental design`:** This column has a very high cardinality (over 10,000 unique values), with many entries being detailed free-text descriptions (e.g., \"See pre-analysis plan.\", full methodological descriptions). This indicates it is not a traditional categorical variable but rather a free-form text field, which will require text analysis rather than simple categorical processing.\n","- **`Randomization method`:** Similar to 'Experimental design', this column exhibits high cardinality (over 7,000 unique values) with descriptive text entries (e.g., \"Randomization done in office by a computer\", detailed method descriptions). This is also more of a free-form text field.\n","- **`Randomization unit`:** This column also has high cardinality (over 5,000 unique values) with diverse free-text descriptions (e.g., \"Individual\", \"Household\", \"School campus\").\n","- **`Data collection completion`:** This column shows a mix of `True`, `False`, and `NaN` values. The presence of `NaN` as the most frequent value (9358 entries) suggests that this information is often not provided.\n","\n","**Conclusion:**\n","This initial assessment has highlighted several data integrity aspects, including significant missingness in many columns, varying success in date conversions, and the identification of several 'categorical' columns that are effectively free-text fields with high cardinality.

For instance, 'Post trial documents csv' (98.80%), 'Program files url' (97.19%), 'Public data url' (96.84%), 'Partners' (96.57%), and 'Secondary IDs' (96.40%) have over 90% missing data, suggesting these fields are often optional or sparsely populated.\n","    *   Conversely, critical columns such as 'Title', 'Url', 'Last update date', 'Published at', 'First registered on', 'RCT\\_ID', 'DOI Number', 'Primary Investigator', 'Status', 'Start date', 'End date', 'Keywords', 'Intervention start date', and 'Intervention end date' are completely populated with no missing values.\n","*   **Data Type Conversion Challenges**:\n","    *   While most date columns (e.g., 'Last update date', 'Published at', 'Start date') successfully converted to datetime objects, two columns experienced significant conversion failures: 'Intervention completion date' had 9,550 failures, and 'Data collection completion date' had 9,643 failures, indicating format inconsistencies or non-date entries.\n","    *   Numeric values were successfully extracted and converted for columns like 'Sample size number clusters', 'Sample size number observations', and 'Total number of observations'. However, many original entries contained descriptive text alongside numbers (e.g., \"96 clusters\", \"6494 women\"), which were handled by extracting the numeric part and coercing non-numeric values to NaN.\n","*   **Column Consistency**: All column names in `df_trials` perfectly matched those defined in `schema.txt`, with no missing or extra columns identified.\n","*   **Categorical vs. Free-Text Fields**:\n","    *   The 'Status' column shows clear, consistent, and expected categories (e.g., 'in_development', 'completed', 'on_going').\n","    *   However, 'Experimental design', 'Randomization method', and 'Randomization unit' were found to have very high cardinality (over 10,000, 7,000, and 5,000 unique values respectively), primarily consisting of free-text descriptions. This indicates they function more as text fields rather than traditional categorical variables.\n","    *   'Data collection completion' mainly contained `NaN` (9,358 entries), `True` (1,656), and `False` (110) values, suggesting it acts as a boolean indicator with frequent missingness.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   Acknowledge the high percentage of missing data in many columns, which may require strategies like imputation, careful consideration during analysis, or potentially dropping these columns if their utility is minimal due to sparsity.\n","*   The free-text nature of several \"categorical\" columns ('Experimental design', 'Randomization method', 'Randomization unit') indicates a need for advanced text processing techniques (e.g., NLP, keyword extraction) if these fields are to be used for structured analysis or categorization.\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1B8v3B8TDE4QlKhRdtCGfXcZ4bPQVSG-R","timestamp":1764877673784},{"file_id":"1krAd8EdagFFLStKybuTl91UvAxmeu_Mc","timestamp":1763084916600}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
